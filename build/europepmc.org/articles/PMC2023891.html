Medizinische Klinik, Mainz; (3) Transplantationschirurgie/Chirurgie von Leber, Gallenwegen und Pankreas, Mainz, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid295685">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Therapeutic decisions in hilar cholangiocarcinoma depend mainly on the longitudinal extention of tumor growth along the bile ducts and on the recognition of distant metastases. Preoperative imaging is increasingly used to define the surgical strategy preoperatively. At the same time, accurate diagnostic evaluation must not delay treatment, and should be cost-effective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 9/97 and 12/02, 82 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were treated at our institution. For the retrospective analysis reported herein 55 of the initial 59 ERCP images, 39 of the initial 40 MRCs and 32 of the initial 38 PTCs were available. ERC and MRC had been performed at the referring institutions by various investigators in 48 and 17 cases, respectively. RESULTS: The mean scores (&#x000b1; standard deviation) of visualization for ERC, MRC, and PTC differ considerably. The results for ERC were significantly worse than those of MRC (<em>p</em>&#x0003c;0.001) PTC (<em>p</em>&#x0003c;0.001), but MRC was also inferior to PTC (<em>p</em>=0.019). ERC scored 1.23 (&#x000b1;0.94) for the right biliary system and 0.97 (&#x000b1;0.77) for the left lobe, respectively. MRC resulted in a appropriate visualization in about 90%, right and left system included. In PTC the visualization of the bile ducts was always perfect. CONCLUSION: ERC may help to recognize a hilar stricture but not its precise localization and intrahepatic extension. Visualization reached by MRC and PTC is significantly better than by ERC. PTC in particular was found to be the most reliable tool to classify hilar cholangiocarcinomas before surgery.</div><div class="p" id="__pid295697"><strong>2</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA AS AN EXTENDED INDICATION IN LIVING-DONOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION</div><div class="p" id="__pid295701">Jonas S, Mittler J, Pascher A, Theruvath T, Thelen A, Klupp J, Langrehr J, Neuhaus P, General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Charit&#x000e9; Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid295704">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The advantages of living donor liver transplantation are an individually available graft and a tremendously reduced waiting-time until transplantation. One consequence is that many centers have extended the pretransplant selection criteria especially for potential recipients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, reports on living donor liver transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma are restricted to few case reports. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have analyzed our experience with 7 patients suffering from cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumors, <em>n</em>=5; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, <em>n</em>=2). RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 20 months (range 2&#x02013;46 months), all patients are alive except for one post-transplant death. Four patients suffering from Klatskin tumors are alive without recurrence; both patients suffering from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are alive with bone and peritoneal metastases. CONCLUSION: Living donor liver transplantation may be beneficial in selected patients suffering from Klatskin tumors while caution should prevail when considering intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.</div><div class="p" id="__pid295712"><strong>3</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />KLATSKIN TUMORS-TREATMENT MODALITIES IN A SINGLE-CENTER EXPERIENCE</div><div class="p" id="__pid295716">Skwarek A, Zieniewicz K, Nyckowski P, Wroblewski T, Michalowicz B, Patkowski W, Najnigier B, Remiszewski P, Pawlak J, Krawczyk M, Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery, Medical University, Warsaw, Poland</div><div class="p" id="__pid295718">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: To evaluate the methods of treatment of patients with Klatskin tumors in one center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 164 patients (88 female, 76 male, mean age 59 years) with Klatskin tumor, treated in the period 1994&#x02013;2003. RESULTS: The main clinical symptoms were: jaundice (100%), pruritus (84%), abdominal pain (52%) and cholangitis (24%). 50.6% patients underwent surgical treatment with curative intention: resections of the extrahepatic bile ducts 28.9%, bile ducts with adjacent liver tissue: left hepatectomy 28.9%, left hepatectomy<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />+<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />segment I 8.4% and extended right hepatec-tomy<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />+<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />segment IV 33.8%. In other cases (49.4%) palliative procedures were performed: intrahepatic segment III/V cholangiojejunal anastomosis in 36 patients, endoscopic stenting in 28 patients and percutaneous transhepatic drainage in 17 patients. In a group of patients treated surgically with curative intention perioperative mortality was 3.8% and 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 26%. In the group of patients treated palliatively 30-day mortality was 7.3% and 1-year OS rate was 10.9%. CONCLUSION: The optimal treatment option for Klatskin tumor patients remains surgical resection, however associated with low mortality, is rarely possible. For palliative treatment in patients in poor general status the recommended method is endoscopic stenting or percutaneous transhepatic drainage.</div><div class="p" id="__pid295721"><strong>4</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />GASTROJEJUNOSTOMY WITH DUODENAL PARTITION FOR UNRESECTABLE PERIAMPULLARY CANCER</div><div class="p" id="__pid295725">Shin JH, Han WK, Surgery, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, South Korea</div><div class="p" id="__pid295728">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The most appropriate palliative treatment to relieve symptoms caused by extrahepatic biliary obstruction appears to be a surgically constructed double bypass. However, gastrojejunostomy may be a disease rather than an operation because the ingested food would take the duodenal route and re-enter the stomach through the gastrojejunostomy. Therefore, there has been a renewed interest in the role of the duodenal partition for preventing this circulus vomiting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 97 patients were treated with palliative loop gastrojejunostomy due to unresectable periampullary cancer at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital between March 2001 and December 2003. Of the 56 patients in this group who underwent prophylactic gastrojejunostomy, 25 patients had both gastojejunostomy and duodenal partition (Group I) and 31 had gastrojejunostomy alone (Group II). RESULTS: The postoperative in-hospital mortality rate was 0% and the morbidity rate was 5.4%. However, the morbidity rate associated with duodenal partition was 0%. Circulus vomiting was absent in patients who had a duodenal partition, although statistical analysis did not show this to be significant. The reason for the statistical insignificance of the result may be the relatively small sample size. CONCLUSION: Due to the ease and safety of the technique, the duodenal partition added to the loop gastrojejunostomy decreased circulus vomiting without prolonging the operative time or increasing the complication rates. This finding suggests that the duodenal partition should be liberally applied in prophylactic gastric bypass procedures.</div><div class="p" id="__pid295730"><em>5</em><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><em><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />INTRAOPERATIVE BILIARY SELF-EXPANDABLE METALLIC STENT PLACEMENT IN UNRESECTABLE HILAR CHOLANGIOCARCIONOMAS</em></div><div class="p" id="__pid295738">Karaliotas C<sup>2</sup>, Sgourakis G<sup>1</sup>, Goumas C<sup>1</sup>, Christofidis T<sup>1</sup>, Papaioannou N<sup>3</sup>, Karaliotas C<sup>3</sup>, (1) 2nd Department of Surgery; (2) Gastroenterology; (3) Surgical Oncology Unit, Red Cross Hospital, Athens, Greece</div><div class="p" id="__pid295760">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: We introduce the method of introperative biliary metallic stent placement in unresectable cholangiocarcionomas, where percutaneous and endoscopic procedures have failed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 2001 to October 2004, 13 patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinomas underwent intraoperative placement of metallic biliary stents. An unyielding effort (endoscopically or percutaneously) had been done preoperatively. After choledochotomy, a metallic self-expandable stent is introduced after forceful tumor pierce with a bougie. A T-tube is inserted in the CBD and a completion cholangiogram is performed in order to investigate stent position and drained hepatic segments. In case of undrained liver lobe or sustained jaundice, an effort for PTBD was done on the second postoperative day. A second cholangiogram was done on the 15th postoperative day. 50 Gy external beam radiotherapy was administered postoperatively. RESULTS: Successful introperative metallic biliary stent placement was feasible in 12 of 13 patients. In 9 of 12 patients the stent was placed in the left biliary tree. PTBD was done in 2 postoperatively. No bile leaks were observed. Cholangitis and moderate degree of hemobilia was dealt with successfully in two patients. 30-day mortality was 7.6% (1/13). Procedural mortality was nil. Relief of jaundice in 91.6% (11/12). Recurrent jaundice in 16.6% (2/12). Median survival was 410 days. Mean stent patency was 9.8 months. Mean length of hospital stay was 10.4 days. Average monthly Karnofsky score was 72.1. CONCLUSION: Introperative placement of self-expandable metallic biliary stents for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinomas is a safe and effective method.</div><div class="p" id="__pid295762"><strong>6</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />INDICATIONS AND OUTCOME OF ENDOSCOPIC PAPILLECTOMY OF THE MAJOR AND MINOR PAPILLA &#x02013; A PROSPECTIVE 5-YEAR STUDY</div><div class="p" id="__pid295766">Will U<sup>1</sup>, Meyer F<sup>3</sup>, Gottschalk P<sup>2</sup>, Bosseckert H<sup>2</sup>, (1) Department of Internal Medicine III, Municipal Hospital Gera, Gera, Germany; (2) Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Jena, Jena, Germany; (3) University Hospital Magdeburg, Department of Surgery, Magdeburg, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid295781">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: To study indication and outcome of papillectomy in suspicious tumor lesions of the papilla of Vater. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 22 males and 17 females (21&#x02013;88 years) underwent endoscopic papillectomy because of a polypoid tumor at the papilla revealed by EUS over 5 years. Follow-up EUS including histologic investigation were performed within 28 days. RESULTS: Group (Gr.) 1 (<em>n</em>=21): Adenoma (<em>n</em>=18), uT1 Ca of high risk patients (<em>n</em>=3) with R0 resection (<em>n</em>=17) vs R1 (<em>n</em>=4; all reapproached using argon beamer). On the 28th post-interventional day, all subjects were free of tumor (recurrent tumor growth, <em>n</em>=3 after 6, 18 and 26 months; range [<em>n</em>=14], 3&#x02013;60 months). Gr.2 (<em>n</em>=8): Contradiction between EUS (infiltrating tumor growth) and histologic finding (adenoma or unspecific inflammation); histological findings: Adenomyomatosis of the papilla (<em>n</em>=5), infiltrating Ca of the papilla or peripapillary region (<em>n</em>=3).

A lot of side effects are described with this technique, particularly anastomotic fistula and sometimes death. Duodenopancreatectomy is not recommended for small tumors. Endoscopic resection may be proposed as an alternative to surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate this new approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2003 and September 2004, 32 ampullomas were diagnosed by endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound. 9 of these were benign or neoplasic T1 (European classification) tumors. Tumoral staging was performed (CT scan, endoscopic ultrasound and mini-probe ultrasound). Evaluation of benefits and risks was done. In these 9 cases we decided to perform endoscopic resection. All of them were performed under complete anesthesia with a video-duodenoscope and a diathermic snare. Pancreatic stent was put in all cases. Finally, pathologic analysis was made after resection. RESULTS: Complete resection was performed in all cases. 1 was classified T2 after pathologic analysis and duodenopancreatectomy was performed. 1 pancreatitis was described but without clinical symptoms (increase of pancreatic enzymes), and treated only by fasting during 3 days. No bleeding, retroperitoneal perforation, or infectious complication were observed. Long-term evaluation was not easy because of the shortness of the study, but no pancreatic duct stenosis or neoplasic relapse has been seen. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic ampullectomy is a safe procedure. Surgery is recommended for bigger tumors. Further evaluation is necessary to confirm these preliminary results.</div><div class="p" id="__pid295899"><strong>9</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />VALIDATION OF A NEW CLINICAL-BIOCHEMICAL- RADIOLOGICAL STAGING SYSTEM FOR GALL BLADDER CANCER</div><div class="p" id="__pid295904">Shukla PJ, Shrikhande SV, Pandey D, Goliwale F, GI Surgical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India</div><div class="p" id="__pid295907">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Gallbladder cancer is one of the commonest GI cancers in Northern India. At the 6th World Congress of the IHPBA we had proposed a new staging system based on clinical-biochemical-radiological parameters. Aim: To validate the new clinico-biochemical-radiological staging system in order to pre-operatively predict the resectability and help in formulating treatment options. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Approximately 160 new patients with gallbladder cancer are received annually at our centre. These include patients with resectable disease, incidentally diagnosed (post-cholecystectomy) disease or advanced disease. In addition to the CT scan features, the presence/ absence of jaundice and the serum CA-19-9 tumour marker levels are included in an objective manner to predict advanced disease and inoperability. RESULTS: In the period January 2003 to October 2004, 27 patients with gallbladder cancer were subject to surgical exploration. The successful resectability rate was only 33% (9/27). This group does not include those patients who were taken up for revision surgery following prior simple cholecystectomy for malignancy. The reasons for unresectability included: extensive nodal disease, porta hepatis invasion, peritoneal nodules and noncontiguous liver metastases. The new staging system (which includes: presence of jaundice, elevated CA-19-9 and CT scan features suggesting extension of disease medially towards the porta hepatis/nodal disease) correlated very favorably with predicting unresectability. 90% of the patients with unresectable disease had at least one or more adverse factors on the staging system. CONCLUSION: By pre-operatively staging the disease in these patients with the proposed new system, it is possible for us to streamline treatment strategies for these patients with objectives of predicting resectability and prognostication. We believe that this system complements the existing TNM and Nevin staging systems and provides a practical clinical based system.</div><div class="p" id="__pid295909"><em>10</em><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><em><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />HILAR CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA(KLATSKIN TUMOR): CURRENT MANAGEMENT</em></div><div class="p" id="__pid295916">Tsalis K<sup>1</sup>, Vasiliadis K<sup>1</sup>, Vergos O<sup>1</sup>, Kalpakidis V<sup>2</sup>, Christoforidis E<sup>1</sup>, Tsachalis T<sup>1</sup>, Betsis D<sup>1</sup>, (1) 4th Surgical Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; (2) Department of Radiology, &#x0201c;G.

Long-term survival can be achieved only after surgical resection, when possible. The aim of this study is to present our experience of the management of 33 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1993 to August 2004, 33 patients (25 men, 8 women) with Klatskin tumor referred to our department. The diagnosis was based on the clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, tumor marker levels and careful evaluation of the extent of the tumor (US, CT, MRI, MRCP, ERCP, PTC). 14 patients had resection of all gross disease and 10 of them had negative histologic margins. Five patients underwent left hepa-tectomy combined with caudate lobe resection. The 30-day mortality rate after tumor resection was 7.1%. Fourteen patients were treated with palliative surgical procedures and 5 patients underwent non-surgical treatment. RESULTS: The resectability rate was 42.4%. Overall survival rate for patients with tumor resection ranged from 6 months to 7.5 years (mean 24.16 months) and for patients with palliative treatment from 1 to 17 months (mean 8.67 months). The mean survival rate in patients with a negative histologic margin was 30.6 months while in those with a positive margin it was 11 months. CONCLUSION: An aggressive surgical approach is warranted in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma because resection offers the only hope for long-term survival.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of cholangitis in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were identified from the multidisciplinary team database. Data including demographic details, procedures, outcome and microbiological cultures were collected on a computerised database. RESULTS: 116 patients (55 males, 61 females) with a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma were seen in our unit between 1999 and 2004. Of these, 104 (90%) underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with a total of 198 performed. 92 (88%) of these patients underwent plastic biliary stenting. Curative surgical resection was later attempted in 43 (37%) of the total patient group. The original stent was changed in 30 (35%) patients, the median number of stent placements was 1 (range 1&#x02013;6). Overall there were 0.21 stent changes per month of survival. Only 24 (26%) patients with stents in situ developed clinical features of cholangitis. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma require biliary stenting, often repeatedly.

The average size of the tumour is 3&#x02013;4 cm, so it is difficult to find by way of imaging examinations. For this reason very often an ERCP examination is made in order to establish the diagnosis. A preoperative bile duct stent is implanted to solve the jaundice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the last 12 years 51 patients were resected due to Klatskin tumour in our department. In the case of 33 patients the examination included an ERCP examination (ERCP group), of which in 10 cases a stent was implanted as well. In 18 cases no ERCP examination was made (NERCP group). In the ERCP group a bacteriological examination of the bile of the proximal ducts was made in 21 cases, as long as in the NERCP group this happened in 11 cases. In both groups we analyzed the result of the bacteriological investigation, the antibiotic resistance of the organisms and the rate of postoperative complications. RESULTS: The bacteriological investigation of the bile in the ERCP group showed a multi-bacterial infection with multi-resistant organisms. The most frequent pathogens were: <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp., <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp., <em>Streptococcus</em> spp. and <em>Entero-coccus</em> spp. In this group wound infection and pneumonia were more frequent and hospitalization was also longer. As long as in the NERCP group there was no postoperative death, 4 patients in the ERCP group died of sepsis in the postoperative period. CONCLUSION: ERCP examination of patients with Klatskin tumours significantly increases the infection risk of the proximal bile ducts with multi-resistant pathogens, and through this, the rate of postoperative septical complications. If the ultrasound examination to be first opted for in case of a mechanic jaundice shows a choledocus of normal diameter, Klatskin tumour should be suspected. In such cases MR cholangiography and eventually PTC are recommended. Taking the results of the bacteriological examinations into consideration, as opposed to the antibiotics used in bile surgery, the antibiotic prophylaxis chosen should be such as can be thera-peutically applied later in case of a persistent infection.</div><div class="p" id="__pid295973"><strong>13</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />REVERSE WILL ROGERS PHENOMENON IN HILAR CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA</div><div class="p" id="__pid295978">Moebius C<sup>2</sup>, Wiedmann M<sup>1</sup>, Caca K<sup>1</sup>, Uhlmann D<sup>2</sup>, Hauss J<sup>2</sup>, Witzigmann H<sup>2</sup>, (1) Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Leipzig; (2) 2nd Department of Surgery, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid295999">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Possible causes underlying the substantial differences in hilar cholangiocarcinoma survival rates observed between Japan and the west may be due to insufficient lymph node dissection in the western world. Therefore, we evaluated disease-free survival rates in our resected patients in relation to extent of lymph node dissection in a retrospective study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study involved 60 patients who underwent resection for histologically proven hilar cholangiocarcinoma in a single centre between 1994 and 2003. Patients were divided into 2 different groups. The first group (<em>n</em>=26) included patients with a maximum of 2 lymph nodes dissected and the second group (<em>n</em>=20) included patients with at least 3 lymph nodes dissected. RESULTS: 14 patients were excluded from the study because of incomplete tumor resection or because N status was not available. There was no difference between sex, age, operating procedure and morbidity in the two groups. There were 3 patients with pN+ status in group 1 and 12 patients with pN+ status in group 2. The median disease-free survival in group 1 was 22.8 months and in group 2 the median disease-free survival was 33.07 months. CONCLUSION: It seems likely that the reverse of the Will Rogers phenomenon&#x02013;that is, less careful staging of patients leading to a lowering of the survival of all stages&#x02013;accounts for the so far unexplained variations between Japan and the Western world in our study population.</div><div class="p" id="__pid296008"><strong>14</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />INTRAHEPATIC HEPATICO-JEJUNOSTOMY IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE KLATSKIN TUMORS</div><div class="p" id="__pid296013">Nyckowski P, Skwarek A, Zieniewicz K, Patkowski W, Najnigier B, Michalowicz B, Wroblewski T, Smoter P, Dudek K, Krawczyk M, Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery, Medical University, Warsaw, Poland</div><div class="p" id="__pid296015">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The authors present the results of the treatment of patients with unresectable Klatskin tumor with the use of intrahepatic hepatico-jejunostomy in segment III or V. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed records of 36 patients (16 male, 20 female; mean age:49 years) comprised 37.5% of all the patients treated from 1994 to 2003 for Klatskin tumor. The main clinical symptoms were: jaundice (100%), pruritus (85%) and cholangitis (24%). In 9 cases before the operations patients underwent (in other centers): endoscopic stenting (55.6%) or percutaneous transhepatic drainage (44.4%). In all of the cases we performed intrahepatic hepatico-jejunostomy in segment III (58.3%) or segment V (41.7%) on Roux-en-Y loop. RESULTS: Postoperative complications were observed in 18% of cases (bile leakage 9%, right pleural exudate 5.3%, infection 3.7%). Two patients (5.6%) died due to postoperative liver failure.

Intraductal spread and implantation in distal common bile duct producing obstructive jaundice is generally considered as inoperable. CASE REPORT 1: A 43-year-old lady presented with recurrent upper abdominal pain of 1 year duration. There was no history of jaundice or loss of weight. On clinical examination, there was no jaundice and abdominal examination did not show any mass or hepatomegaly. On evaluation, ultrasonography showed a polypoidal mass within the gallbladder and common bile duct (CBD) showed dilatation of 1 cm, but there was no intrahepatic biliary radicle dilatation. CT scan and MRCP confirmed the diagnosis. At laparo-tomy findings were a fleshy polyp in the fundus of gallbladder 3&#x000d7;2 cm with no serosal infiltration, common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm, no definite mass in CBD. CBD exploration was done, no. 3 dilator passed with difficulty. A small bit of polypoidal tissue was removed from CBD for biopsy. Radical cholecystectomy and T-tube drainage of CBD was done. Pathology report came as carcinoma of gallbladder and polypoidal tissue from CBD shows similar histology. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was done on sixth postoperative day. On follow-up at 2 months, patient is asymptomatic and healthy. CASE REPORT 2: A 44-year-old lady presented with recurrent attacks of right upper quadrant pain of 1 year duration. On clinical examination, there was no jaundice and abdominal examination showed a hard gallbladder and hepatomegaly. On evaluation, ultrasonography showed a mass within the gallbladder and common bile duct showed dilatation with mass in the distal CBD. Radical cholecystectomy with pancreaticoduodenectomy was done. Patient had a disease-free survival for 1 year. CONCLUSION: Carcinoma of gallbladder with intraductal spread is still amenable to surgical resection.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bile was collected from patients admitted with malignant biliary obstruction during endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography or during surgery. Bile was collected from patients with benign biliary disease as controls. The samples were analyzed for concentrations of different heavy metals using atomic absorption spectrometry. The mean level of each metal in the study groups (biliary malignancy and pancreatic malignancy) and the control group were compared using standard statistical methods. RESULTS: 101 bile samples were analyzed (30 cholangiocarcinoma, 43 pancreatic carcinoma and 28 benign). When the samples from patients with cholangiocarcinoma were compared with the benign group, the mean concentration of each metal was higher in the malignant group except zinc but did not reach significant level. Similarly, metal concentrations in patients with pancreatic carcinoma were not significantly different from the benign group. The mean level of cadmium reached closest to statistical significance in each subgroup of biliary cancer compared to the benign group. When all the samples from malignant disease were taken together and compared with the benign group, the mean concentration of cadmium was significantly higher in the former (<em>p</em>=0.02). CONCLUSION: This study supports the possibility that higher levels of heavy metals in bile may be associated with pancreato-biliary malignancy. However, enough evidence is not available to implicate heavy metals as a direct cause of these tumours.</div><div class="p" id="__pid296037"><strong>17</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />HEPATOBILIARY CYSTADENOCARCINOMA: A CASE REPORT</div><div class="p" id="__pid296042">Karamarkovic AR, University Center for Emergency Surgery, Surgical Dpt 3, Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro</div><div class="p" id="__pid296045">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Hepatobiliary cystadenoma is a rare neoplasm occurring in middle-aged women. The clinical feature is not marked but abdominal fullness and abdominal mass are the most common symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 49-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic with right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort and 6-cm-sized unilocular hepatic cystic mass. The medical history was not unusual; laboratory tests were normal. Serum CEA, CA 19-9, and alpha-fetoprotein levels were normal. CT demonstrated a unilocular cyst in Couinaud's segment S4. The mass was localized on the under surface of the liver between the round ligament and gallbladder, above the the hilar structures, without communication with biliary tract. Anatomical segmentectomy S4 was performed with curative intention (R0 resection). A unilocular cyst surrounded by a thin fibrous wall was filled with mucinous and gelatinous fluid. Histologically, the inner surface was lined with mucin-producing cuboidal epithelia accompanied by focal papillary growth, which is consistent with cystadenoma. The stromal mass was <em>in situ</em> papillary adenocarcinoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient is doing well 14 months after surgery, without signs of tumor recurrence. CONCLUSION: Cystadenocarcinomas usually arise from preexisting cystadenomas. The treatment of choice is complete surgical resection.</div><div class="p" id="__pid296050"><strong>18</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />IS MIRIZZI SYNDROME ASSOCIATED WITH GALLBLADDER CANCER?</div><div class="p" id="__pid296054">Ramia JM, Muffak K, Villar J, Garrote D, Ferr&#x000f3;n JA, General Surgery, UH Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain</div><div class="p" id="__pid296058">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Mirizzi syndrome (MS) is an uncommon clinical situation. The incidence of gallbladder cancer (GBC) associated with MS appears to be much higher than GBC associated with cholelithiasis. We present two patients with MS type II and GBC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case 1: A 74-year-old woman presented abdominal pain and jaundice. Analytical results showed cholestasis. Ultrasonography/CT: gallbladder not visible and extrahepatic bile duct highly dilated and contained an 18-mm stone. We performed cholecystectomy, primary fistula closure, choledocotomy, stone extraction and placement of a Kehr's tube. Histological study reported a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (T3NxMx). The patient refused a relaparotomy for radical surgery and died 12 months after surgery due to disease progression. Case 2: A 72-year-old man presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. Analytical results showed a marked cholestasis. Ultrasonography/CT showed a 3-cm liver mass compatible with a gallbladder neoplasm. Intraoperative biopsy (gallbladder and periportal lymph node) was reported as adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent cholecystectomy, resection of the extrahepatic bile duct, portal lymphadenectomy and segment IVb-V resection. Histologic study reported a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (T4N1M0) Ten months after surgery, the patient is alive, with no recurrence of the tumor observed at follow-up. CONCLUSION: We highlight that all patients with GBC and MS (our cases and literature search), presented type II MS. We fully support the recommendation to perform an intraoperative gallbladder biopsy in all patients with MS, especially in those with type II and elevation of CA19-9. If the presence of a GBC is detected, radical surgery can be performed in the same surgical act.</div><div class="p" id="__pid296060"><strong>19</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />SMALL CELL NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOR OF THE BILE DUCT</div><div class="p" id="__pid296064">Ramia JM<sup>3</sup>, SanJuan F<sup>1</sup>, Lopez R<sup>1</sup>, Orbis JF<sup>1</sup>, Moya A<sup>1</sup>, De JuanM<sup>1</sup>, Mir J<sup>1</sup>, Froufe A<sup>2</sup>, (1) General Surgery, Hospital La Fe de Valencia, Valencia; (2) Pathology, Hospital La Fe de Valencia, Spain; (3) University Hospital Virgen de las Nieves, General Surgery, Granada, Spain</div><div class="p" id="__pid296092">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Neuroendocrine tumors of the bile duct (NETBD) are an exceedingly rare neoplasm. The origin of NETBD remains unclear. We present a patient with small cell neuroendocrine tumor of the bile duct and discuss etiology and treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 57-year-old man was referred with a 5-day history of jaundice, acholia and choluria, without abdominal pain. No neuroendocrine symptom was present. Liver analysis was: bilirubin: 5.9 mg/dl AST: 208 UI/l, ALT: 354 UI/ l, LDH: 249 UI/l. CA19-9: 58.1 UI. CT, US and MR cholangio-graphy showed a stenosis in the middle third of the bile duct with an extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. We performed a resection of the extrahepatic bile duct, periportal lymphadenectomy, and cholecystectomy. Pathologic examination revealed a small cell undifferentiated neuroendocrine tumor of 3 cm diameter with vascular thrombi, microscopic nerve and vascular invasion. No lymph nodes were involved. Tumoral areas were positive for Grimelius. Immunohistochemistry study: tumor stained positive for enolase, synaptophysin, S-100, cromogranin, and was doubtful for AE1 and AE3, and negative for CAM5.2, ALC, CD20, CD3, CD30. The postoperative course was uneventful. After 4 months, the patient died from tumoral recurrence confirmed by FNAC. CONCLUSION: NETBD account for 0.2&#x02013;2% of all neoplasms of the extrahepatic biliary system. The clinical presentation does not differ from cholangiocarcinoma. MR cholangiography is a very useful diagnostic method. The preferred therapeutic approach to NETBD is resection. Early metastases to regional lymph nodes appear to be common, and rapid disease progression and death is the rule.</div><div class="p" id="__pid296094"><strong>20</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />BILE DUCT OBSTRUCTION CAUSED BY A BILIARY MUCIN-PRODUCING PAPILLARY NEOPLASM</div><div class="p" id="__pid296098">M&#x000fc;llner K<sup>1</sup>, Gy&#x000f6;keres T<sup>1</sup>, Schafer E<sup>1</sup>, Kovacs F<sup>1</sup>, Rusznyak K<sup>1</sup>, Burai M<sup>1</sup>, Varga G<sup>3</sup>, Keleti G<sup>2</sup>, Pap A<sup>1</sup>, (1) Department of Gastroenterology, MAV Hospital, Budapest; (2) Department of Surgery, Szt Laszlo Hospital, Budapest; (3) Department of Surgery, MAV Hospital, Budapest, Hungary</div><div class="p" id="__pid296129">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Biliary mucin-producing papillary neoplasms are rare causes of biliary obstruction and recurrent pancreatitis. The histological appearance and the clinical behaviour of these biliary tumors largely resemble the properties of the pancreatic mucin-producing neoplasms. RESULTS: A 48-year-old woman was repeatedly hospitalised due to acute pancreatitis and obstructive jaundice. ERCP erroneously localised the obstruction at the level of the papilla, incomplete endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed. She arrived at our institution because of recurrent jaundice, 2 weeks after papillotomy. Sonography showed dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. ERCP revealed mucinous bile coming through the patulous papilla while causing obstruction. At the hepatic bifurcation, a mild stenosis appeared with secretion of descending mucin bubbles. Repapillotomy, nasobiliary and endo-biliary drain implantation was performed. Per oral cholangioscopy also verified the location of the mucin-producing adenoma at the bifurcation of the hepatic ducts. The histological and cytological examination of the samples taken from the ductus hepaticus showed papillary mucin-producing adenoma. CONCLUSION: While 40&#x02013;70% of similar pancreatic lesions tend to transform into malignant tumors, no data exist about the frequency of malignant transformation in the case of biliary mucin-producing adenomas. However, the risk for secondary biliary cirrhosis and the possibility of malignant transformation justify early surgical approaches. In our case resection and hepato-jejunostomy was performed, confirming the mucin-producing adenoma at the hepatic bifurcation.</div><div class="p" id="__pid296131"><strong>21</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />TREATMENT OF THE COMPLICATION CAUSED BY THE RECIDIVISTIC HILAR CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA</div><div class="p" id="__pid296136">Lukovich P, Kupcsulik P, Zsirka A, 1st Surgical Department, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary</div><div class="p" id="__pid296138">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The hilar cholangiocarcinoma grows slowly and very rarely produces metastases. In spite of the small size of the tumour, oncologically radical resection is only feasible-owing to the anatomical position-in approximately 35&#x02013;50% of the cases. This makes recidivity frequent. The recidivistic cancer involves the hilus of the liver, compresses the surrounding organs and develops different complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 51 patients underwent surgical resection in the 1st Surgical Department of Semmelweis University from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2003. Complete tumour-free surgical margins were found in only 41% of the cases. The mean follow-up was 28.2 (4&#x02013;54) months. RESULTS: 14 patients were treated for complications caused by local recurrence. These were mechanical jaundice (12 cases), bleeding oesophageal varices (3 cases), gastric outlet obstruction (2 cases), liver abscess (3 cases), pain caused by the infiltration of the coeliac ganglion (3 cases) and a case of obstruction of the ureter by a retroperitoneal metastasis. Most of the complications could be solved by minimally invasive therapy (percutaneous transhepatic endoprothesis or drainage, endoscopic sclerotherapy, ultrasound-guided drainage, percutaneous blockade of the coeliac ganglion). Twice we carried out palliative re-resection of the tumor. CONCLUSION: The fact that resected patients may survive several years as long as patients treated with endoprothesis and irradiation only survive half a year, has brought a change in the way Klatskin cancer surgery is considered: resection of the tumour should be striven for&#x02013;even by way of R1 resection. Therefore the risk of recurrence will increase.</div><div class="p" id="__pid298121"><strong>22</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />FIRST ADULT CASE OF COMMON BILE DUCT RHABDOMYOSARCOMA EMBRYONAL TYPE IN KOREA</div><div class="p" id="__pid298125">Kim KH<sup>1</sup>, Kim JS<sup>1</sup>, Lim KW<sup>1</sup>, Park IY<sup>2</sup>, Lee KH<sup>3</sup>, (1) Department of Surgery, Uijeongbu St Mary Hospital, Catholic University of Korea, Uijeongbu; (2) Department of Surgery, Bucheon, Family of Holy Hospital, Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon; (3) Bupyeng, Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, Catholic University of Korea, Bupyeng, Republic of Korea</div><div class="p" id="__pid298143">We present a rare case of an embryonal-type rhabdomyosarcoma at common bile duct.

Because of these limitations, the incidence of finding benign, inflammatory lesions in patients resected for presumed hilar carcinoma is 15%. A more reliable preoperative diagnosis is highly desirable in view of the extent of surgical intervention. Advances in proteomics like surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry potentially provides a powerful diagnostic tool for biliary strictures. We hypothesize that employing the SELDI-TOF technique to bile enables us to differentiate between benign or malignant biliary strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bile was collected from 20 patients with a biliary tract malignancy or benign biliary stricture from percutaneus biliary drainage tubes. The protein mass spectrometric profiles of the bile samples were obtained by SELDI-TOF technique and 2D gel electrophoresis. Diagnosis was confirmed histologically after resection or surgical biopsy. RESULTS: After optimizing the technique for bile, we obtained reliable mass spectrometric profiles in bile. Remarkably, malignancy was distinguished from benign disease including primary sclerosing cholangitis by the presence of prominent and specific peaks between 7.5 and 13.5 kDa in 90% of the malignant cases. These findings were validated by 2D gel electrophoresis. CONCLUSION: We conclude that SELDI-TOF analysis has the capacity to detect malignancy in bile. This novel technique can provide biomarkers of malignancy to improve diagnosis and management of patients presenting with a biliary stricture.</div><div class="p" id="__pid298174"><strong>24</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />HIGH EXPRESSION OF CLAUDIN-4 IN HUMAN CHOLANGIOCARCINOMAS</div><div class="p" id="__pid298178">Lodi C<sup>2</sup>, Szijarto A<sup>1</sup>, Holczbauer A<sup>2</sup>, Szabo E<sup>2</sup>, Batmunkh E<sup>2</sup>, Kiss A<sup>2</sup>, Illyes G<sup>2</sup>, Schaff Z<sup>2</sup>, Kupcsulik P<sup>1</sup>, (1) 1st Department of Surgery; (2) 2nd Department of Pathology, Semmelweis University, Semmelweis, Budapest, Hungary</div><div class="p" id="__pid298210">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Cell adhesion molecules play an important role in carcinogenesis, especially claudins, being part of tight junctions. The importance of certain claudins in development of several tumors has been shown, and some of them have even been suggested as a future therapeutic target. For this reason, the aim of our study was to analyse the expression of claudins in cholangio-carcinomas (CCs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A tissue microarray comprising 24 bile duct tumors, arising from different localisations (gallbladder, common bile duct, intrahepatic bile ducts) was constructed to investigate claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, -7 expression by immunohistochemistry. Claudin-4 was further investigated by Western blot analysis on 5 human surgically resected, snap-frozen CC specimens. Subcellular localisation of claudin-4 was detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: Intensive membranous immunolabeling was found for claudin-4 in BDTs of different origin. A single band of the expected size was detected on Western immunoblots and revealed a strong expression of claudin-4. Confocal microscopy confirmed the increased expression of claudin-4 on the membrane of CC cells. CONCLUSION: Our data are the first to report a significantly increased claudin-4 expression in CCs. The results represent a novel feature of CCs and claudin-4 protein could well become a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for cholangiocarcinomas, as it has been suggested for pancreatic and ovarian cancers.

More radical approaches have been proposed, including systematic liver resection and portal vein resection when needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term survival in patients resected for Klatskin tumor, and determine the main prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1989 to 2004, 47 patients with Klatskin tumors have been operated with curative intention. There were 37 men and 10 women, with a mean age of 60&#x000b1;11 years. Preoperative biliary drainage was used in 14 cases (30%). Hepa-tectomy was performed in 41 patients (87%), portal vein resection was associated in 11 patients (23%), and duodenopancreatectomy in 1 patient. RESULTS: Nine patients died during hospitalization after resection. There was postoperative morbidity in 37 patients and mean hospital stay was 22&#x000b1;18 days (range: 4&#x02013;108). Margins of bile duct resection were free from tumor on histologic examination in 37 cases (79%). Mean patient survival, excluding postoperative mortality, was 32&#x000b1;22 months (range 4&#x02013;106). The cumulative survival rate was 74% at 1 year, 53% at 3 years, and 39% at 5 years. Univariate analysis indicated only the histopathologic grade as a significant prognostic factor for survival.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of intrahepatic cholangioenteric bypass to the segmental bile duct B3 in patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The confluence pattern and surgical anatomy of the bile duct branch B3 of segment S3 of the liver was studied in 33 liver casts. It is important to understand the detailed anatomy of B3, its confluence patterns and its relation to the segmental portal venous branch P3. We did not register any anatomical variations of segmental biliary ducts B2 and B3. RESULTS: Since March 2001, we have performed intrahepatic segmental bile duct B3 cholangio-jejunostomy by Roux-en-Y fashion utilizing a round ligament approach in 13 patients with malignant obstructive jaundice due to unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (8 cases) and gallbladder cancer (5 cases). There were no postoperative surgical complications (postoperative bleeding, bile leakage, abscess formation) in our series. Operative mortality rate after B3 cholangiojejunostomy was 7.7% (one patient). The palliation of symptoms was effective in the postoperative period. Median survival after cholangioenteric bypass was 9 months (range 1&#x02013;22 months). CONCLUSION: Intrahepatic B3 cholangiojejunostomy can provide useful palliation from jaundice, pruritus and cholangitis with acceptable mortality and morbidity rates.

Diagnostic work-up and surgical strategy have been shown to influence results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 9/1997 and 9/2004, 111 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were treated at our institution. The results of routine diagnostic work-up (ERC, PTC, CT and MRI) were compared with the surgical specimen, and their influence on surgical strategy as well as on survival was assessed. RESULTS: Resection was performed in 78 patients (9 hilar tumor resections, 69 en-bloc resections of tumor and liver; resection rate 71%). Hospital mortality was 5.1%. Curative resection was achieved in 73% of the resected patients. Right, extended right and left hepatectomy were performed in 22,12 and 35 patients, respectively. The resection to be performed was predicted in 80% of the patients, the extent of the tumor was best predicted by PTC. Overestimation of the extent of the tumor occurred more frequently (30%) than underestimation (10%). 5-year survival in resected patients was 30% (median survival 813 days) compared to 0% (median survival 117 days) in non-resected patients. After curative resection 5-year survival was 48%, in patients with R0/N0 situation it was 61%. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of routine diagnostic work-up in patients with hilCC allows for preoperative decisions in the majority of patients. The resection rate and the rate of curative resection may exceed 70%.

In Period 2, 14 patients (61%) remained disease-free with a median follow-up of 20 months (range 5&#x02013;40 months). CONCLUSION: An aggressive surgical approach in the management of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma was associated with improved operative and survival outcomes.</div><div class="p" id="__pid298341"><strong>30</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />HILAR CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA: LIVER TRANSPLANTATION AND PARTIAL PANCREATODUODENECTOMY (VIDEO)</div><div class="p" id="__pid298347">Jonas S, Thelen A, Neuhaus P, General, Visceral &#x00026; Transplantation Surgery, Charit&#x000e9; Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid298349">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: In the surgical therapy of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, no-touch techniques and wide margins can only insufficiently be complied with. In 1992, liver transplantation and partial pancreatoduodenectomy (LTX/Whipple) as a combined en bloc resection was introduced into our therapeutic algorithm as a strategy to eradicate the entire biliary tract without touching the tumor. Due to the favorable results which can meanwhile be obtained with right trisectionectomy and portal vein resection, only non-resectable hilar cholangiocarcinomas are evaluated for LTX/ Whipple. Local irresectability may be due to an associated PSC with bilateral disease or a bilateral duct infiltration beyond the umbilical fissure on the left. The umbilical fissure is the utmost topographical landmark indicating resectability by right trisectionectomy unless infiltrated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1992 to 2004, 16 patients underwent LTX/Whipple. Most hilar cholangiocarcinomas (<em>n</em>=9) were eventually node-positive. RESULTS: The postoperative 60-day mortality rate was 12.5%; the rate of curative resections was 94%. 1- and 5-year-survival rates after curative resections were 71% and 39%, respectively. Recurrent tumors arose mainly as implantation metastases. Recurrent malignancy was observed in 8 of 16 patients including 4 patients suffering from peritoneal carcinomatosis. The other 4 patients suffered from tumors at the jejunojejunal anastomosis, at the terminal ileum or within the abdominal wall (<em>n</em>=2). CONCLUSION: Though the rate of curative resections increased by LTX/Whipple, we have modified this procedure. Today a double-stapling technique of the gastric stump and the upper jejunum is used in order to minimize the risk of implantation metastases, which increases under immuno-suppression. This modification is in analogy to the double-stapling technique used in total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer.</div><div class="p" id="__pid298357"><strong>31</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />THE USE OF LAPAROSCOPYAND INTRA- OPERATIVE ULTRASOUND FOR ASSESSMENT OF THE RESECTABILITY OF CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA</div><div class="p" id="__pid298362">Pattenden CJ, Barlow A, Garcea G, Sutton C, Neal C, Dennison A, Berry D, Hepatobiliary Surgery, Leicester General Surgery, Leicester, UK</div><div class="p" id="__pid298364">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma have inoperable and therefore incurable disease at presentation due to the extent of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of laparoscopy with or without intra-operative ultrasound in patients with potentially resectable disease on cross-sectional imaging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our multidisciplinary team database was searched for patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma between 1999 and 2004. Patient data included demographic details, procedures and outcome and were collected on a computerized database. RESULTS: 116 patients (55 males, 61 females) with a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma were identified between 1999 and 2004. Of these 67 (58%) had potentially resectable disease on pre-operative radiological imaging. Laparoscopy was performed in 54 (81%) of these patients prior to resection, with 34 of these undergoing simultaneous intra-operative ultrasound. 22 (41%) patients were deemed inoperable at laparoscopy (9 due to extrahepatic disease, 11 due to extensive intrahepatic disease and 2 due to both). 30 patients who had had laparoscopy went on to have open surgery, of these 6 (20%) were found to be inoperable at that time. Two patients were medically unfit for laparotomy. Thirteen patients proceeded directly to open surgery, without staging laparoscopy: 5 (38%) were then found to be inoperable. CONCLUSION: Over 40% of patients with potentially resectable cholangiocarcinoma on their pre-operative radiological imaging are understaged and deemed inoperable at staging laparoscopy. Laparoscopy is an essential pre-operative staging investigation for cholangiocarcinoma.</div><div class="p" id="__pid298366"><strong>32</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY (PDT) IMPROVES SURVIVAL IN NON-RESECTABLE HILAR CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA-ENCOURAGING PRELIMINARY RESUL TS</div><div class="p" id="__pid298370">Tait S<sup>2</sup>, Ziyaie D<sup>1</sup>, Polignano F<sup>1</sup>, Hamdan K<sup>2</sup>, (1) Surgery, Ninewells Hospital &#x00026; Medical School, Dundee; (2) Surgery &#x00026; Molecular Oncology, Ninewells Hospital &#x00026; Medical School, Dundee, UK</div><div class="p" id="__pid298385">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Most patients (80%) with hilar cholangiocarcinoma require palliation with biliary stent(s) and have median survival of 3&#x02013;4 months, even with chemo/radiotherapy. This study evaluates efficacy of Photofrin-PDT for advanced (non-resectable) hilar cholangiocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2002 to November 2004, 17 patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma were offered PDT and 12 proceeded; 5 refused and received systemic gemcitabine. Stents were placed at ERCP and brushings obtained for cytology. Patients were given photosensitiser Photofrin 2 mg/kg, then PDT 48 h later via ERCP (<em>n</em>=11) or PTC (<em>n</em>=1). Drug was activated by 630-nm laser using optical fibre to deliver a light dose of 180J/cm2. Patients were re-stented after PDT, antibiotics, monthly follow-up. RESULTS: There were 9 males and 3 females, median age 70 (range 59&#x02013;78). Bismuth type II-1, IIIa-4, IIIb-3, IV-4. PDT was given 2.3 months from diagnosis (range 1&#x02013;5, median 2). Mean hospital stay was 12 days (range 3&#x02013;48, median 8). Average survival was 683 days [CI 446,920] and median survival was 546 days [CI 427,665] after PDT, compared with mean and median survival of 161 [67,225] days and 200 days with chemotherapy (Kaplan-Meier log rank, <em>p</em>=0.0046). Overall survival with PDT was 100% at 6 months, 75% at 1 year, and 50% at 18 months. Early side effects: abdominal pain 1, cholangitis 1, haematemesis 1, mild skin photo-toxicity 3. Number of re-admissions was 2.4 (range 1&#x02013;5, median 2), re-interventions 3 (range 0&#x02013;4, median 3). There was no in-hospital or 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates PDT to be an effective treatment for non-resectable hilar cholan-giocarcinoma that is associated with substantial prolonged survival. This observation merits further validation in a larger multi-centre randomised controlled trial.</div><div class="p" id="__pid298397"><strong>33</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />HILAR CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA-A SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE</div><div class="p" id="__pid298401">Iype S, Subhalal N, Kuruvilla AP, Surgical Gastroenterology, Medical College Hospital, Trivandrum, Kerala, India</div><div class="p p-last" id="__pid298404">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Hilar resection, especially in combination with liver resection, results in substantial morbidity and mortality, which clearly influences the overall outcome. In the present study resectability rate, operative mortality, long-term survival, and factors contributory to long-term survival were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1991 and June 2004, 81 consecutive patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were studied retrospectively. Patients presented with obstructive jaundice, pruritus and loss of weight. The main preoperative evaluation tool was ultrasonography combined with Doppler examination. PTC, ERCP and MRCP were done in a few selected cases. Patients undergoing hepatic resection with extrahepatic bile duct resection, patients undergoing bile duct resection only and patients undergoing palliative bypass were retrospectively compared for operative morbidity, mortality and survival. RESULTS: Analysis of the surgical management of 81 consecutive patients with carcinoma at the confluence of the hepatic ducts showed that 23 (28%) were resectable after comprehensive pre-operative investigation and underwent tumour resection&#x02013;5 local resections and 19 liver resections. The 30-day hospital mortality was 21% and mean duration of survival was 15 months (8 patients are still alive). The quality of life was also much improved after resection. Curative resection was possible in 72% of patients. In patients treated with palliative surgery the hospital mortality was 16% and the mean survival was 7 months. CONCLUSION: It is clear that cancer of the main hepatic duct junction has become a curable disease. Aggressive surgical approaches to obtain curative resections could bring about a better prognosis in hilar cholangiocarcinoma independently of whether hepatic resection or local resection is performed.</div></div></div>
