It is estimated that 3&#x02013;5% of all pancreatic cancer cases are caused by germline mutations in known predisposing genes, though some families may carry genes unrelated to any identified syndrome. In 2002, the Associazione Italiana Studio Pancreas (AISP) launched a collaborative study to investigate these issues in Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1) To determine cancer risks, both of pancreas and of other sites, for the relatives of the probands with pancreatic adenocarcinoma; 2) to collect a large number of consecutive pedigrees for studies of segregation and linkage analysis. Family history of cancer and blood samples are collected from all incident cases with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Pedigrees are recorded in a centralized database. Selected samples are forwarded to genetic labs for DNA analysis. RESULTS: Three collaborating centers provided 351 pedigrees ascertained consecutively, including 3685 informative relatives. Pancreatic cancer among first-degree relatives was reported in 25 families (7.1%), 3 including two affected relatives; this corresponded to 2.8-fold risk increase compared to the general population at age 65 and to 3.0-fold increase at age &#x0003e;75 years. Adding the second-degree relatives to the analysis, 33 families (9.4%) reported positive family history (1.8-fold risk increase at both ages 65 and &#x0003e;75 years). Familial aggregation of cancers at any site was highly significant; gastrointestinal and uterine cancers were present in large excess. CONCLUSION: The present study provides the foundations for investigating the genetic susceptibility to pancreatic cancer in Italy.</div><div class="p" id="__pid262563"><strong>2</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />LONG-TERM SURVIVAL AFTER PANCREATIC CANCER RESECTION: A EUROPEAN HISTOLOGICAL EVALUATION</div><div class="p" id="__pid262568">Wirtz M, Rockefeller University New York, New York, USA</div><div class="p" id="__pid262571">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The vast majority of patients diagnosed with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (PDAC) die within 1 year after diagnosis. Only a few patients survive more than 5 years after surgery. The current European study re-evaluates the histology of patients surviving &#x0003e;5 years as well as in a matched control group of patients surviving only 3&#x02013;12 months after surgery. The aim was to find histological differences between long- and short-term survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The entire records of the nationwide Finnish and Danish cancer registers and the local cancer registers of the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, were screened for the diagnosis pancreatic cancer (ICD:C25) for the years 1990&#x02013;1996. A matched group of patients with a survival between 3 and 12 months served as control. The original histological slides were primarily re-evaluated by the local pathologist, thereafter by two reference pathologists in a blinded manner. RESULTS: A total of 38 long-term survivors were histologically re-evaluated. In 24 cases the primary diagnosis of a DAC could be confirmed. 37% of the 5-year survivors were suffering from pancreatic lesions/tumors different from PDAC. Papillary carcinoma and IPMT were the most common differential diagnosis in this group followed by endocrine tumors, chronic pancreatitis and bile duct carcinoma. Surprisingly, the short-term survival group showed the same range of mis-classification (36%). Surprisingly, the short-term survival group showed the same range of misclassification in the first place. CONCLUSION: The histological classification of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains difficult especially due to newly described tumor entities like IPMTs. There is no obvious histological difference between long- and short-term survivors in pancreatic cancer.</div><div class="p" id="__pid262573"><strong>3</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />NON-RADICAL PANCREATIC CANCER RESECTIONS</div><div class="p" id="__pid262577">Balzano G<sup>1</sup>, Zerbi A<sup>1</sup>, Reni M<sup>2</sup>, Rocchetti S<sup>1</sup>, Leone BE<sup>3</sup>, Vanessa C<sup>1</sup>, Di Carlo V<sup>1</sup>, (1) Surgery, S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data. Study group: 296 patients undergoing resection for pancreatic cancer (1990&#x02013;2002). R1 status was defined histologically, R2 status intraoperatively. Data were analysed by the x2, log-rank and Cox analysis (covariates: radicality, diameter, stage, grading, nodal status, adjuvant therapies). RESULTS: 175 patients (59%) were classified as R0, 68 patients (23%) as R1 and 53 patients (18%) as R2. The posterior margin was the most frequently involved (69.4%). Local relapse (LR) was detected in 40% of cases after R0 resection, 39% after R1 and 55% after R2 (<em>p</em>=0.4). IORT was applied in 127 patients: it has no effect to reduce local relapse in either R0 patients (<em>p</em>=0.9), or Rl (<em>p</em>=0.3), or R2 (<em>p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>1). The survival of R2 patients was worse than R0 patients <em>p</em>&#x0003c; 0.001), but the prognosis of R1 and R0 patients was similar (<em>p</em>=0.2). 2-and 5-year survival rates were 38.6% and 14.8% in R0 patients, 32.7% and 8.6%, in R1 patients; 13.9% and 6.9% in R2 patients. The multivariate analysis confirmed that R2 status is an independent prognostic factor (<em>p</em>=0.02), whereas R1 was not (<em>p</em>=0.4). CONCLUSION: It is important to differentiate R1 and R2 resections because R1 does not significantly influence LR or survival, whereas. R2 have a worse prognosis. IORT had no effect to reduce LR.</div><div class="p" id="__pid262630"><strong>4</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />DETECTION OF TUMOR CELL DISSEMINATION IN PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA PATIENTS BY CK 20 RT-PCR PREDICTS SURVIVAL</div><div class="p" id="__pid262635">Vogel I<sup>2</sup>, Soeth E<sup>1</sup>, R&#x000f6;der C<sup>1</sup>, Kremer B<sup>1</sup>, Kalthoff H<sup>1</sup>, Sektion Molekulare Onkologie, UKS-H, Klinik f.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1994 and 2003, 172 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma underwent surgery. Bone marrow samples and venous blood were taken preoperatively and analyzed for disseminated tumor cells by nested CK 20 RT-PCR. RESULTS: Disseminated tumor cells were detected in 81 (47.1%) of the 172 patients in the bone marrow and/or the venous blood. Detection rates increased with the UICC tumor stage. Univariate survival analysis of all 172 resected patients according to Kaplan-Meier was statistically significant for radicality of the operation (<em>p</em>&#x0003c;0.0000), the UICC stage of the tumors (<em>p</em>=0.0011) and the detection of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow and/or venous blood (<em>p</em>=0.05). Patients with well and moderately differentiated tumors (G1 and G2) had a significantly longer survival (<em>p</em>=0.045) than patients suffering from poorly differentiated tumors (G3). A positive CK 20 status in the bone marrow and/or blood of patients with G1 and G2 tumors exhibited a significant negative prognostic impact on their survival (<em>p</em>=0.046). CONCLUSION: Disseminated tumor cells can be detected in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by CK 20 RT-PCR. Detection rates are stage-dependent, and survival analysis demonstrated statistically significant data, especially in the group of well and moderately differentiated tumors showing a better overall prognosis.</div><div class="p" id="__pid262672"><strong>5</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />PARTIAL RESECTION OF THE PORTAL VEIN IN PANCREATICODUODENECTOMY IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</div><div class="p" id="__pid262676">Aselmann H, Winkler M, Oeser M, Neipp M, Mordukhovych J, Klempnauer J, Viszeral- und Transplantationschirurgie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid262678">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple's operation) is the treatment of choice for malignancies of the head of the pancreas and the juxtapapillary region of the duodenum and is an option in chronic pancreatitis. Especially in malignant diseases, tumor invasion or adherence of the portal vein is a common occurrence. Therefore, vascular resection is necessary to achieve R0 situation. The clinical value of this procedure, however, is still discussed controversely. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the treatment results of 189 patients undergoing Whipple's operation from January 2000 until April 2004. RESULTS: The two groups (with/without vascular resection) did not differ significantly in age, gender or underlying disease. Resection of the portal vein was performed in 31 (18%) patients, 158 (62%) underwent surgery without vascular resection. Overall hospital mortality in patients with and without portal vein resection (1/31, 3.2% vs 7/158, 4.4%), overall morbidity (38% vs 45%,p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />&#x0003e;<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />0.1) and median hospital stay (25 vs 29 days, <em>p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />&#x0003e;<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />0.1)</em> did not differ significantly. Postoperative hemorrhage occurred in 11% with and 15% without portal vein resection. Reconstruction of the portal vein was performed as end-to-end anastomosis in 22 cases (71 %); in 9 patients (29%) implantation of an alloplastic prosthesis was required, mortality in these two groups was comparable. CONCLUSION: Pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with partial resection of the portal vein is not associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Performed by an experienced surgeon, portal venous resection can expand the resection rate without significantly endangering the patient. Therefore this treatment option should be considered in these otherwise irresectable patients.</div><div class="p" id="__pid262684"><strong>6</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />REG IV, A HITHERTO UNDESCRIBED PRODUCT OF THE REG GENE FAMILY, IS SPECIFICALLY EXPRESSED IN PANCREATIC PP CELLS</div><div class="p" id="__pid262688">Yalniz M<sup>1</sup>, Pour PM<sup>1</sup>, Lesuffleur T<sup>2</sup>, Moniaux N<sup>2</sup>, Aubert JP<sup>2</sup>, (1) UNMC/Eppley Cancer Center 6805, University of Nebraska Medical Center; (2) Place de Verdun, Unite 560 INSERM, Omaha, NE, USA</div><div class="p" id="__pid262706">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The Reg gene family has been implicated in a variety of functions including regeneration, proliferation and malignancy. Their physiological function, however, is not well understood. Recently, a novel member of the Reg gene family, Reg IV, has been identified and its expression in normal and diseased gastrointestinal mucosa including dysplasia and cancer has been reported. Its expression in pancreatic tissue, however, has not yet been investigated. We report, for the first time, the expression of Reg IV in the normal and diseased pancreas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of Reg IV was examined by a polyclonal antibody in five normal pancreases from organ donors, four chronic pancreatitis, 13 pancreatic cancer specimens, and in cultured human islet cells by multi-labeling immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The expression of Reg IV was limited to pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells. Multi-labeling technique indicated that there were a few PP cells that did not express Reg IV. In cancer tissue, the number of PP cells, and with that of Reg IV expression, was significantly increased. Cultured human islet and ductal cells immunoreacted with anti-Reg IV but not with anti-PP antibody, indicating that pancreatic polypeptide is not the target of the Reg IV antibody. No staining of pancreatic exocrine cells or endocrine cells other than PP cells were observed and no cancer cells were immunoreactive with the antibody. CONCLUSION: In the pancreas, Reg IV is a marker for PP cells. Its upregulation seems to be associated with hyperplasia and malignancy.</div><div class="p" id="__pid262708"><strong>7</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />EARLY AND ENDURING FUNCTIONAL AND NUTRITIONAL RESULTS OF PYLORUS PRESERVATION VS CLASSIC WHIPPLE PROCEDURE FOR PANCREATIC CANCER</div><div class="p" id="__pid262712">Niedergethmann M, Shang E, Saar J, Farag-Soliman M, Willeke F, Post S, Department of Surgery, University-Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid262715">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: There have been many supportive data that the pylorus-perserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) might be equal to the classic Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) in terms of oncological radicality. However, few reports are available on the early postoperative and enduring functional changes, the nutritional status, body composition, and the quality of life years after surgery. The aim of this study was to compare these changes in a retrospective and prospective setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In May 1998 the standard surgical approach in the Department of Surgery, University-Hospital Mannheim changed from PD to PPPD. Early postoperative and enduring functional changes, quality of life, oncological radicality, and long-term nutritional status were compared in a group of 111 patients after PD (1996&#x02013;1998) and 128 patients after PPPD (1998&#x02013;2002). In a retrospective manner the intra- and postoperative course was evaluated. Prospectively, we analyzed functional, nutritional, and oncological outcome after 5 years in PD, and after 2 years in PPPD patients.

However, more T4 stages were diagnosed in the PD group (PPPD 3% vs PD 11%), and more extended (venous) resections were performed in the PD group (PPPD 7% vs PD 24%). Morbidity (32% vs 30%) and mortality (5% vs 3%) did not differ between the two groups.

It is also estimated that around 4% of the disease is genetic. There is, however, no information about a relationship between the causative factor and the histological type of the tumors. It is presently unclear whether the same histological and biological type of cancer develops in obese people or in persons with familial pancreatic cancer. The prevalence of ductal type of adenocarcinoma in more than 90% of pancreatic cancer cases casts doubts about a relationship between the causative agents and tumor type. The rarely occurring cancers, on the other hand, could be more promising for the establishment of such a relationship as shown for certain rare types of tumor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective epidemiological study was performed in 230 cases. Of these, the histological tumor tissue from 80 cases collected from the local hospitals were found suitable for the study. Comparison was made between the histological classification of tumors and available epidemiological data. RESULTS: Morphologically, 55 of 80 classifiable tumors were ductal adenocarcinomas, 9 cystadenocarcinoma, 3 anaplastic. The remaining 13 tumors were of uncommon type (5 microglandular, 4 small cell, 3 adenosquamous cell and 1 squamous cell carcinomas). Correlation of these 13 tumors with the epidemiological data showed a strikingly high incidence of microglandular adenocarcinomas that occurred in four cases, all four were middle-aged black obese women; three of these four cases had family history of cancer and two had history of exposure to agricultural toxins. There also seemed to be an association between adenosquamous cell carcinoma, race, gender, obesity and exposure to toxins, similar to the situation with the microglandular carcinoma cases. All cases with small cell (anaplastic) carcinomas occurred in smokers and mostly in men (3 of 4). CONCLUSION: The presented data may be the first message that such correlative studies could be useful when done on a broader spectrum of investigation. Multidisciplinary work employing cohort and genetic epidemiology, bioinformatics, pathomorphological and molecular biological information could shed more light on this dark area of our knowledge.</div><div class="p" id="__pid262901"><strong>13</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN PATIENTS AFTER PANCREATICODUODENECTOMY FOR DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE PANCREATIC HEAD</div><div class="p" id="__pid262906">Schniewind B<sup>3</sup>, Bestmann B<sup>1</sup>, Vogel I<sup>2</sup>, F&#x000e4;ndrich F<sup>3</sup>, Henne-Bruns D<sup>4</sup>, Kremer B<sup>3</sup>, Kuechler T<sup>1</sup>, (1) Reference Center Quality of Life in Oncology, University Hospital Kiel, Kiel, Germany; (2) Surgery, Kiel Municipal Hospital, Kiel; (3) Clinic for General and Thoracic Surgery, University Hospital Kiel, Kiel, Germany; (4) Clinic for Visceral- and Transplantation Surgery, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid262930">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: QoL was evaluated in patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. Special attention was given to the influence of extended lymphadenectomy and classic Whipple procedure (PPD) versus pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1993 to 03/2004 QoL was analyzed in a prospective single-center study in 91 of 169 patients, who underwent resection of the pancreatic head for ductal adenocarcinoma. All patients received either classic PPD <em>(n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>34) or comparable PPPD <em>(n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />57).</em> Most patients had additional extended lymphadenectomy (ELA; <em>n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>70), remaining patients underwent regional lymphadenectomy (RLA; <em>n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />21).</em> QoL was assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 supplemented by a disease specific module. Data were collected preoperatively, before discharge, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. The statistical &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test, Mann-Whitney u-test, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression. RESULTS: No significant difference was found concerning long-term survival between the PPD and the PPPD group as well as between the ELA and the RLA group. General QoL significantly decreased after surgery and only slowly recovered to almost pre-operative level within the period of 24 months. This applied for most QoL scales. Compared to the RLA group, patients with ELA reported clinically significantly higher levels of diarrhea, pain and poorer global health. Compared parameters of QoL between PPD and PPPD showed disadvantages particularly concerning pain scales in the PPPD. However, the PPPD group included a significantly higher proportion of ELA patients. CONCLUSION: Comparison of surgical techniques of reconstruction did not demonstrate significant differences in terms of general QoL, but an extension of lymphadenectomy seemed to impair the patients' QoL.</div><div class="p" id="__pid262948"><strong>14</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />SURGICAL TREA TMENT OF PANCREATIC METASTASES OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA</div><div class="p" id="__pid262952">Sotiropoulos GC, Lang H, Brokalaki E, Broelsch C, General Surgery and Transplantation, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid262955">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The pancreas is an unusual site for metastases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), sometimes occurring many years after nephrectomy.

In the second case, tumor was found in the tail of the pancreas and remnant of the right kidney. This was the third recurrence of the original tumor after an initial left nephrectomy and two subsequent partial right nephrectomies in the past. Treatment in the first case consisted of excision of the tumor in the right upper arm, Whipple operation, and thyroidectomy. In the second case, a distal pancreatectomy and rest right nephrectomy were undertaken.

MUC1 is over-expressed and differentially glycosylated by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and there is evidence <em>in vitro</em> that it could contribute to invasive and metastatic potential by cell surface adhesion properties modification and by dendritic cell function modulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic impact <em>in vivo</em> of MUC1 in patients with pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MUC1 concentrations were measured prospectively in 155 patients with histologically confirmed pancreatic cancer at the diagnosis. MUC 1 concentrations were related to patient outcome by both univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Patients with high concentrations of MUC 1 (H-MUC1: &#x0003e;25 units/L; 31.6% of patients) had a significantly shorter overall survival pattern than those with low concentrations (L-MUC1) (median survival: 175<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />+<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />32 vs 350<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />+<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />44; <em>p</em>=0.0017). As a prognostic factor, MUC1 was independent of tumor size, presence of metastasis, surgery treatment, and patient age. MUC1 was also predictive of outcome irrespective of the type of therapy administered, i.e. whether chemotherapy or radiotherapy was administered. As well as being prognostic in the total population of patients, MUC 1 also predicted outcome in different subgroups of patients, including those submitted to resective surgery node-negative and node-positive disease, high and low grading. CONCLUSION: Assay of MUC1 is a relatively inexpensive, convenient, and noninvasive method for evaluating prognosis in newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer patients.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265254"><strong>16</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />RE-RESECTIONS FOR TUMOROUS PANCREATIC LESIONS &#x02013; A WORTHWHILE RISK IN SELECTED PATIENTS</div><div class="p" id="__pid265260">Leder GH<sup>2</sup>, Str&#x000e4;ter J<sup>1</sup>, Beger HG<sup>2</sup>, Henne-Bruns D<sup>2</sup>, (1) Pathology; (2) Surgery I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid265275">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Re-resections for tumorous pancreatic lesions are controversial due to their putative high risk and doubtful prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with re-resections for recurrent or secondary tumor after resection for a pancreatic neoplasm or chronic pancreatitis were selected from our pancreatic tumor database (1992&#x02013;2004). RESULTS: 14 patients (8 male, 6 female, median age 59 years) underwent re-resections. There were 3 groups of patients: (A) 7 with malignant tumor at both operations (5 adenocarcinoma, 1 serous cystadenocarcinoma, 1 chronic pancreatitis with ductal dysplasia but CA19&#x02013;9 &#x0003e;3500 U/ml after first resection and recurrence within 9 months); (B) 5 with primary benign tumorous lesions and secondary malignant tumor (2 chronic pancreatitis, 1 mucinous cystadenoma with chronic pancreatitis, 1 islet cell adenoma with chronic pancreatitis, 1 borderline-IPMT); and (C) 2 with benign tumors at both resections (1 adenoma of Vater's papilla, 1 IPMT-adenoma). Primary resections were: 5 (pp)Whipple's, 4 duodenum-preserving pancreatic head, 3 left, 1 corpus resection, 1 ampullectomy. Re-resections were: 4 (pp)Whipple's, 3 subtotal head/corpus, 1 left resection, 6 pancreatectomies. Median operating time of re-resections, estimated intraoperative blood loss, stay in the intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay were 350 min, 1000 ml, 6 and 18 days, respectively. Major complications were 1 intra-abdominal bleeding and 1 subphrenic abscess. Mortality was 0%. Median survival after first and second resection was: (A) 31 and 19 months and (B) 91 and 20 months, respectively.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the pattern of failure and clinicopathological factors influencing the disease-free survival after curative resection of ampullary and pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2001, 88 consecutive patients with ampullary (<em>n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>36) and pancreatic head (<em>n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>52) adenocarcinoma underwent duodenopancreatectomy with curative intent (R0). Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard technique in order to determine prognostic factors following surgery. RESULTS: The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 31.8% and 35.4%, respectively, for all patients. DFS was significantly better after resection of ampullary as compared to pancreatic head carcinoma, i.e. 60.8% vs 16.4% (<em>p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>0.0001), respectively. In patients with ampullary carcinoma, cancer recurrence was determined by the number of lymph nodes metastases <em>(p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>0.009) and lymph vessel invasion <em>(p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>0.025).

Cancer recurrence occurred in 12/36 (33%) and 40/52 (77%) patients after resection of ampullary and pancreatic head carcinoma, respectively. In both groups the dominant site of first recurrence was intra-abdominal, 100% (12/12) in patients with ampullary cancer and 92.5% (36/40) in patients with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: The most common site of primary recurrence after curative surgery of ampullary and pancreatic head adenocarcinoma is intra-abdominal. Therefore, the search for new and effective loco-regional (neo-)adjuvant therapeutic modalities should further be stimulated.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265304"><strong>18</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />PANCREATICOGASTROSTOMY, MORE THAN AN ALTERNATIVE!</div><div class="p" id="__pid265309">Satyadas T, Groot Wassink T, Habbab Y, Berry M, Iadarola M, Sinclair M, Rae D, Eastern Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Unit, Ipswich Hospital, Ipswich Suffolk, UK</div><div class="p" id="__pid265311">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Management of the pancreatic stump following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is still very much debated. Traditionally, the pancreatic stump is anastomosed to the jejunum. Recently, there has been an increased interest in pancrea-ticogastrostomy (PG), as it is thought it may be safer. However, pancreaticojejunostomy is still the most common method. Our aim was to assess the safety of PG in terms of major morbidity, mortality and relaparotomy rates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected on 48 consecutive patients who had pancreaticogastrostomy for the pancreatic stump as part of PD from January 2001 to April 2004 in a single institution. All PGs were made with a 3-cm pancreatic remnant being telescoped into the gastric lumen with stenting of the main pancreatic duct (Dunk method). We collected data on pre-operative clinical and pathological features, peri-operative parameters, morbidity, relaparotomy and mortality rates. The main outcome measures were major morbidity, mortality and relaparotomy rates. RESULTS: Of the 48 patients who had PG, there were 2 in-hospital deaths (4.2%). One was due to cerebrovascular accident and the other secondary to sepsis from a pancreatic leak. There were 7 patients with major morbidity (14.6%). Of these, 5 were anastomotic leaks, of which 4 were pancreatic and 1 was biliary. All these patients were treated successfully by CT-guided percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. There were 2 cases of significant gastric stasis proved on contrast imaging. One of 48 patients required relaparotomy (2.1%).

The main advantage of this operation compared with major resections is that it permits sparing of normal pancreatic parenchyma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The operation is carried out by exposure of pancreatic neck involved by the lesion and incision of the peritoneum along the superior and inferior margin of the part of the gland to be resected. Thereafter the gland is dissected from the splenic artery and porto-mesenteric axis and divided with a 1-cm clear margin. The cephalic stump is sutured and the distal stump is anastomosed end-to-end or end-to-side with a Roux-en-Y jejunal loop. We treated 20 patients with this technique. The indications for CP were: serous cystadenoma in 7, mucinous in 3, solid cystic papillary tumor in 1, metastasis from renal cancer in 1 and endocrine tumor in 8 patients. RESULTS: Mortality rate was 0% and morbidity rate was 35%; pancreatic fistula occurred in 25% of the cases and was treated conservatively. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 18 days. Postoperative endocrine and exocrine functional tests were normal in all controlled patients. All the patients are alive without clinical and imaging evidence of disease.

Selection for surgery has been made easier by improved diagnosis and staging. Consequently, reports of long-term survival after resection of left-sided malignancy have emerged. Here we report 8 men and 12 women (median age 63 years; range 49&#x02013;75), who were operated on because of a malignant tumour of the pancreatic body and/or tail. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient charts were analysed for all resections of a malignant tumour of the body and tail of the pancreas from 1977 to 2003. RESULTS: Sonography was positive in 15/17 (88%) patients and CT scanning in 9/9 (100%). Preoperative cytology was positive in 10/20. 14 patients had distal pancreatic resection; 5 with resection of stomach, renal capsule, portal vein (2) and renal vein. Six patients had total pancreatectomy with three portal vein resections. Median operating time was 360 min, median blood loss 2500 ml and median tumour size 5 cm. Adenocarcinoma was present in 16, mucinous cystade-nocarcinoma in 2, and endocrine cancer in 2 patients. Stage IA was present in one case, stage IB in three, stage IIA in two, stage IIB in seven and stage III in seven cases. R0 and R1 radicality was achieved in 17 and 3 cases, respectively. 60% of patients had postoperative complications such as wound infection (4/20), wound dehiscence (2/20), abscess (2/20), postoperative jaundice (1/20), intra-abdominal bleeding (1/20), and anastomotic bleeding (1/20). Medical complications were pneumonia (3/20), and pleural exudate (2/20). One patient died of sepsis with multiple organ failure. Median survival of all patients was 17 months (range 0&#x02013;176; IQR 11&#x02013;44).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 63 patients with pancreatic tumor (staged resectable from the US) we proceeded with: dual-phase spiral CT, ERCP, and DSA preoperatively. The surgery and histopathology of the tumor established the diagnosis. RESULTS: 51 patients (80.64%) had malignant tumor and the rest 12 (19.36%) had benign tumor. The distinction between malignant and benign tumors was: sensitivity of CT 88% and of ERCP 81%. The histopathological diagnosis was confirmed in 43 patients from surgical specimens and in 17 from percutaneous core biopsy. The accuracy of CT for the arterial infiltration was 85% and of the DSA 80%. The infiltration of veins was demonstrated with CT in 64% and with DSA in 54% of the patients. The accuracy of DSA was 81% and of CT 56%. The accuracy of CT for local non-resectability (combining extrahepatic tumor invasion and vessel infiltration) was 90%. CONCLUSION: Dual-phase spiral CT is a safe, noninvasive, and accurate technique for detecting and staging of pancreatic carcinoma.

By the introduction of preservation of the gastric antrum and pylorus by Traverso the operating risk has been reduced and the technique simplified. In many retrospective studies it could be demonstrated that both techniques yield the same results. However, it is still controversial, if the Traverso operation is onco-logically equal to the Kautsch-Whipple procedure; moreover, none of these controversial questions have been addressed in a prospective controlled randomized trial. Thus, our group started such a trial 420 years ago and was able to follow up all surviving patients over this period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 121 patients referred to the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the Heinz Kalk-Hospital Bad Kissingen from 1 January 1984 to 1 January 1994, 40 patients were selected after having been investigated and declared as resectable. Full written consent was obtained before the operation; the study was carried out in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. 23 patients were randomly allocated to the Kautsch-Whipple procedure (group I) and 17 to the Traverso operation (group II) using the sealed-envelope method. Postoperatively all surviving patients were followed up after 6 months and thereafter every year by endoscopic, radiological and functional exocrine and endocrine investigations up to 20 years. RESULTS: One patient in group I died of pancreatic fistula during the first 30 postoperative days; the hospital mortality in group II was nil. Long-term survival according to Kaplan-Mayer after 10 years was 13% in group I and 20% in group II. After 20 years the survival in group I was stable at 20%, whereas in group I it was 6% which is a significant difference. In addtion, digestive and exocrine functions were better restored in group II. CONCLUSION: Thus it could be shown in the first worldwide prospective controlled randomized trial that there is no oncologic difference between Kautsch-Whipple and Traverso operation in the treatment of pancreatic head cancer. Moreover the latter procedure guarantees better nutritional and exocrine recovery and is technically easier to perform. Last not but not least on a long-term basis this operation makes a significantly longer survival possible.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265391"><strong>24</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />PROGNOSTIC RELEVANCE OF CYTOKERATIN 20-ASSOCIATED TUMOR CELL DETECTION IN PANCREATIC AND PERIAMPULLARY CANCER</div><div class="p" id="__pid265395">Wolters HH<sup>1</sup>, Dieler M<sup>1</sup>, Schleicher C<sup>1</sup>, Schubert S<sup>2</sup>, Mundel T<sup>1</sup>, Senninger N<sup>1</sup>, Colombo-Benkmann M<sup>1</sup>, (1) Department of General Surgery, University of Munster, Munster, Germany; (2) Molecular Biology, Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Munich, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid265420">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The objective of the present prospective study was to evaluate the prognostic relevance of disseminated tumor cells detected by cytokeratin (CK) 20 RT-PCR in bone marrow (BM) and venous blood (VB) of patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer.

CONCLUSION: More than two-thirds of patients investigated have systemic dissemination of tumor cells at the time of diagnosis. However, in the first postoperative year this is without significance for survival.

Curative resection is the only effective procedure in the treatment of patients with this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the period 1992&#x02013;2003, 139 patients with malignant ampullary tumors were treated in our clinic. There were 80 male patients and 59 female. Mean age was 57.7 years (range 25&#x02013;87). All patients underwent surgical treatment. 79 patients underwent curative surgical resections, including 35 pancreaticoduodenal resections (PDR): 24 Whipple procedures and 11 pylorus-preserving (PPDR); 44 local resections (LR): 27 papillectomy and 17 extended papillectomy. Resectability rate was 56.8%. We performed 11 PPDR, including 2 PPDR with duodenal reconstruction after our technique: we performed PPDR with the preservation of the distal part of duodenum; the reconstruction includes step-by-step formation of pancreatico-jejunal, hepatico-jejunal, proximal and distal duodeno-jejunal anastomoses with the isolated jejunal loop. RESULTS: 1 patient after died PDR. The postoperative mortality in PDR group made up 2.9%. Actuarial 5-year survival was 33.4% in the PDR group, 38.5% in the extended papillectomy group and 52.2% in the papillectomy group. CONCLUSION: Local resections as more physiological procedures are indicated in patients with localized tumors. PPDR with duodenal reconstruction could be indicated in patients with malignant ampullary tumors, the advantages are connected with preservation of the function of duodenojejunal connection.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265456"><strong>26</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />PYLORUS PRESERVATION DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DELAYED GASTRIC EMPTYING FOLLOWING PANCREATICODUODENECTOMY</div><div class="p" id="__pid265460">Horstmann O, Ghadimi M, Strohmeyer A, Becker H, Department of General Surgery, University Clinic G&#x000f6;ttingen, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid265462">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: DGE has been specifically attributed to pylorus preservation.

First, groups were analyzed with regard to structural similarity; then, they were compared with special emphasis on DGE and other postoperative complications. Finally, further prognostic factors were sought that had an impact on DGE. RESULTS: The PPPD group was comparable to the KWPD group, but not to the DPPHR population. The in-clinic course following DPPHR compared favorably to PPPD as well as KWPD and here no DGE occurred. The overall morbidity rates of PPPD and KWPD were comparable (moderate and severe complications in 15% versus 26% and 18% versus 5%, respectively, n.s.); one patient died in hospital (mortality rate 0.7%). DGE was distributed evenly among PPPD (12%) and KWPD patients (21%, n.s.) and it was noted almost exclusively when other postoperative complications were present <em>(p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />&#x0003c;<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>0.0001). No further prognostic factors influencing DGE could be identified. CONCLUSION: Pylorus preservation does not increase the frequency of DGE. DGE almost exclusively occurs as a consequence of other postoperative complications. Therefore, DGE should not be used as an argument to advocate hemigastrectomy in PPPD.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265477"><strong>27</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />THE MANAGEMENT OF CANCER METASTASIZING TO THE PANCREAS</div><div class="p" id="__pid265482">Barron P, Doumit G, Mimeault R, General Surgery, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada</div><div class="p" id="__pid265484">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Patients presenting with a mass in the pancreas are rarely found to have isolated metastases from a non-pancreatic primary. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of such lesions and review management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 01/04/96 and 01/01/2003 at the Ottawa Hospital a tertiary care centre associated with University of Ottawa, 388 patients presenting with a localized pancreatic mass (head 314, body 30, tail 44) causing obstructive jaundice or other abdominal complaints were identified. Chart review was conducted to detect instances where the pancreatic mass was found to be a cancer from a non-pancreatic primary. Patients presenting with pancreatic masses as part of a spectrum of widely metastatic disease were excluded from the study. RESULTS: 5 cases of isolated metastatic cancer to the pancreas were identified; 3 renal cell cancers, 1 breast cancer, and 1 carcinoid tumour. 3 tumours were located in the head of the pancreas, 1 in the body and 1 in the tail. One patient had two lesions, one in the head and the other in the tail. One renal cell cancer, the breast cancer and carcinoid tumour were resected for cure. All patients are alive at 54, 66, and 84 months, respectively. One renal cell cancer had invasion of the portal vein and received palliative radiation treatment only. Another renal cell cancer had significant co-morbidities and was judged unfit for surgery. The pathological diagnosis was made following surgery in the resected cases, as it is not our practice to perform pre-operative biopsy in radiologically resectable pancreatic lesions. No postoperative adjuvant treatment was given. CONCLUSION: Our results show that such lesions are rare but should be suspected in patients with a history of previous malignancy. If operable, long-term survival may be obtained. An isolated metastasis to the pancreas from a carcinoid tumour has not been reported previously.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265486"><strong>28</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />THREE INDEPENDENT FACTORS INFLUENCE SURVIVAL AFTER CURATIVE RESECTION FOR PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA</div><div class="p" id="__pid265491">Gulbinas A, Barauskas G, Pundzius J, Department of Surgery, Kaunas University of Medicine, Kaunas, Lithuania</div><div class="p" id="__pid265494">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: To evaluate long-term survival of patients surgically treated for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and to determine independent factors influencing survival.

However, some cases of benign inflammatory masses mimicking pancreatic carcinoma have been reported in the literature. We describe four patients undergoing surgery for preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic head carcinoma, with a histology of inflammatory pseudo-tumour, underlining the need for an aggressive surgical approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients were admitted for pancreatic head mass. All were male, aged 37&#x02013;40 years (mean 38.7). Three of four patients had a previous history of alcohol abuse. Abdominal CT showed a large mass in the head of the pancreas defined as 'malignant neoplasm'. Three patients underwent Whipple procedure, while in a fourth patient a 'palliative' Roux-en-Y hepatico-jejunostomy was performed. Patients undergoing Whipple procedure had primary closure of pancreatic stump. RESULTS: All patients survived surgery, with prompt return to normal bowel function. Those undergoing Whipple procedure developed temporary postoperative pancreatic fistula. This resolved spontaneously from 30 to 90 postoperative day. The patient with hepatico-jeunostomy alone underwent biopsy intra- and post-operatively, both specimens giving negative results. Histology in patients undergoing Whipple procedure was 'chronic pancreatitis' in two cases and pancreatic pseudo-tumour in the third patient. CONCLUSION: Cases of benign masses in the head of pancreas mimicking pancreatic carcinoma have often been reported in recent literature. Preoperative radiological diagnosis has proved unreliable in our series, as well as in other reported cases. As chronic pancreatitis is considered an additional risk factor for pancreatic cancer, an aggressive surgical attitude in cases of preoperative diagnostic dilemma seems justified.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265525"><strong>30</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />CYSTIC TUMORS OF THE PANCREAS &#x02013; RADICAL OR ORGAN-PRESERVING RESECTION?</div><div class="p" id="__pid265530">Siech M<sup>2</sup>, Thumerer S<sup>1</sup>, Henne-Bruns D<sup>1</sup>, Beger HG<sup>1</sup>, (1) Department of General Surgery, University of Ulm, Germany; (2) Ostalb-Klinikum Aalen, General Surgery, Aalen, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid265544">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Cystic tumors comprise only 1 % of all pancreatic tumors.

Follow-up time was 3&#x02013;60 months. Tumours were staged according to the pTNM classification (UICC 1997). Immunohistochemistry was done on paraffin-embedded blocks from tumour sections. Quantitative determination of p27 expression was based on the proportion of p27-positive cells (&#x0003c;10%= negative). Pearson test, survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test were used. RESULTS: Positive p27 expression was detected in 21 tumours (45.7%), whereas 24 tumours (53.3%) were p27-negative. There were no significant correlations between p27 index and stage, lymph node involvement, or completeness of tumour removal (R0 vs R1/R2). Median survival time in patients with p27-positive tumours was 25 months, whereas in patients with p27-negative tumours it was 30 months (<em>p</em>=0.73).

We evaluated this approach in patients treated over a 6-month period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1-04-04 and 30-09-04, based on their presenting bilirubin levels and other logistical factors, jaundiced patients who might be suitable for fast-track management were identified. Data on complications and hospital stay were compared with those patients in whom a conventional pathway (with biliary drainage) was used during the same time period. Data were also compared with a group of patients from the preceding 6 months (1-10-03 to 30-9-04). RESULTS: Six patients were fast-tracked and 12 patients were treated in the conventional pathway. Fast-track patients median (range) serum bilirubin level (micromol/l) was 310 (162&#x02013;391) at time of the operation. Median (range) of time from referral to operation, 14days (6&#x02013;33) vs 42 (26&#x02013;126), was significantly shorter in fast-track patients vs conventional patients. Length of hospital stay at 18 days (11&#x02013;28), surgical complications and mortality in fast-track patients were similar to those for conventional patients. Prior to surgery the 12 conventional patients underwent a total of 25 biliary drainage procedures resulting in 3 major complications. Comparison with the group of patients from the previous time period indicated that the conventional group were not disadvantaged. CONCLUSION: Fast-track management of patients with distal biliary strictures is safe and gives clear benefit in terms of reducing the waiting time to surgery and the number of biliary drainage procedures per patient.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265644"><strong>34</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />PHASE III TRIAL CAPRI (ADJUVANT CHEMORADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY OF PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA) VERSUS 5-FUALONE</div><div class="p" id="__pid265648">Schmidt J<sup>1</sup>, M&#x000e4;rten A<sup>1</sup>, Schmitz H<sup>1</sup>, Lindel K<sup>2</sup>, Goldschmidt H<sup>3</sup>, Herrmann T<sup>3</sup>, Stremmel W<sup>3</sup>, Ho A<sup>3</sup>, Debus J<sup>2</sup>, Diehl V<sup>4</sup>, B&#x000fc;chler M<sup>1</sup>, (1) Department of Surgery; (2) Department of Radiology; (3) Department of Internal Medicine; (4) NCT, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid265685">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas has an especially poor prognosis. The 5-year survival for all stages is &#x0003c;1% with a median survival of 4&#x02013;6 months. Even after surgical intervention with a curative intention the 2-year survival is only 25%. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We initiated this summer a phase III trial where we compare chemoradioimmunotherapy (CapRI) with 5-FU plus folinic acid, i.e. the best arm of the first large European randomised ESPAC-1 trial. Primary objective is the overall survival in both arms. Secondary objective is to evaluate the role and the mechanism of interferon alpha 2b in patients' chemoradiation regimen, to assess the toxicity, the disease-free interval, the quality of life and to test different factors for their potential role as predictive markers. A total of 110 patients with R0 or R1 resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be enrolled. Recruiting phase should be finished after 1&#x000bd; years. With a follow-up of 2 years a total running-time of approx. 3&#x000bd; years should be expected. RESULTS: The chemoradioimmunotherapy protocol is based on results from a phase I/II trial from the Virginia Mason Clinic. They have recently published data of postoperative cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, interferon alpha-2b, and external-beam radiation administered following pancreaticoduodenectomy. They have treated 43 patients with mainly stage III tumors. 84% had positive lymph nodes and 19% had positive cut margins. After a mean follow-up of 31.9 months, 67% of the patients were still alive.

The aim of our multicentric study was to determine whether or not the diagnostic process is rational, uniform, and if correct diagnosis and staging are reflected in effective treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed initial symptoms, length of the diagnostic process, use of imaging methods and their algorithm, and the use of individual therapeutic methods in four centers specializing in hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery. RESULTS: The most frequent first symptom was dyspepsia in 35 patients followed by pain in 33 and jaundice in 24. Radical resection was performed in 24 patients, exploratory laparotomy in 14, palliative surgery in 35 and chemotherapy in 14 patients. Mean time from the onset of the first symptoms to presentation (time I) was 32&#x000b1;28 days. Mean time of the diagnostic process to specific treatment (time II) was 3.1&#x000b1;3.2 months (1&#x02013;24 months). Mean time I in patients presenting with dyspepsia was 44.1&#x000b1;25.7 days, in patients presenting with jaundice or pain 30.0&#x000b1;27.8, and in those who underwent resection 26.5&#x000b1;24.1 days. Mean time II in these groups was 3.7&#x000b1;4.4, 2.8&#x000b1;2.2, and 2.1&#x000b1;1.5 months, respectively. Ultrasound was the most frequently used imaging method (160 cases) followed by CT (116), ERCP (103), endosonography (30), and MR (7). The mean number of diagnostic procedures per patient was 4.3&#x000b1;1.6. Fine needle biopsy was performed in 16 patients. The most frequent algorithm of imaging methods was ultrasound followed by ERCP and CT. CONCLUSION: The process of establishing the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is not uniform and the imaging methods are used abundantly. The decision-making process undertaken preoperatively is not sufficient, as reflected by the inadequately high rate of explorations in cases when radical resection could not be performed. Despite the immediate availability of all imaging modalities, the process of diagnosis in pancreatic cancer is long depending on the first symptoms, which can influence resectability. In resected patients, the process of diagnosis was significantly shorter.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265712"><strong>36</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />A CASE OF OSTEOCLAST-LIKE GIANT CELL TUMOR WITH DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA OF PANCREAS &#x02013; FOCUSING ON HISTOPATHOLOGICAL, IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL, ULTRASTRUCTURAL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES</div><div class="p" id="__pid265716">Cho CK<sup>1</sup>, Koh YS<sup>1</sup>, Kim JC<sup>1</sup>, Kim HJ<sup>1</sup>, Park CH<sup>2</sup>, Joo YE<sup>2</sup>, Lee WS<sup>2</sup>, Rew JS<sup>2</sup>, Kim SJ<sup>2</sup>, Jeong YY<sup>3</sup>, (1) Department of Surgery; (2) Department of Internal Medicine; (3) Department of Radiology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea</div><div class="p" id="__pid265750">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Osteoclast-like giant cell tumor of pancreas (OGTP) is a very rare neoplasm and its clinical behavior and histiogenesis are still controversial. Recently we experienced a case of OGTP with ductal adenocarcinoma resected surgically, so herein we report the case with the results of histopathological, immunohistochemical (IHC), ultrastructural and molecular biological studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient was a 63-year-old woman who underwent operation for resection of pancreas tumor. The performed operation procedure was en bloc excision of mass with distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, left adrenalectomy, partial resection of gastric upper body, tumor thrombectomy in splenic vein. We examined the resected tumor by microscopic examination, IHC study, electron microscopy (EM), and molecular biological studies of K-ras gene analysis. RESULTS: In microsopic findings, the tumor is composed of typical ductal adenocarcinoma and surrounding mononuclear cells (MNC) intermingled with osteoclast-like giant cells (OGC) and pleomorphic large cells. In the IHC study, ductal adenocarcinoma cells are positive for cytokeratin and EMA, and OGC are strongly positive for CD68. MNC are positive for CD68 and lysozyme, and pleomorphic large cells are strong positive for vimentin. In EM findings, prominent nucleoli with dispersed clumps of heterochromatin and the cytoplasm containing ample mitochondria, moderate amount of rough ER without evidence of epithelial differentiation were observed in MNC. In OGC, multiple nuclei with dispersed chromatin and fine chromatin rim, and cytoplasm characterized by abundant mitochondria with variable size, free ribosome, dilated empty rough ER. In analysis of K-ras gene mutation, there was no mutation at codon 12&#x02013;13 in ductal adenocarcinoma cells, MNC and OGC. CONCLUSION: We report a case of OGTP with ductal adenocarcinoma focusing on histopathological, IHC, ultrastructural and molecular biological studies. In the present case, OGC and MNC were different in origin from ductal cells and suggested to be non-neoplastic and mesenchymal in origin.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265752"><strong>37</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />EARLY AND LATE OUTCOME AFTER PANCREATICODUODENECTOMY FOR CANCER IN THE ELDERLY</div><div class="p" id="__pid265757">Scurtu R, Jaeck D, Oussoultzoglou E, Rosso E, Bachellier P, Weber JC, Centre de Chirurgie Visc&#x000e9;rale et de Transplantation, CHU Hautepierre, Strasbourg, France</div><div class="p" id="__pid265759">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Radical surgery is the only valid treatment for pancreatic cancer and for periampullary tumors. Before the early 1990s pancreaticoduodenectomy was not recommended in patients over 70 years because of associated high mortality and morbidity. Currently, increased experience, advances in periopera-tive care and better patient selection have reduced the mortality and morbidity rates after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Therefore pancreaticoduodenectomy has been performed in patients over 70 and even 75 years with acceptable results. The aim of this study was to identify if there is any threshold in patients' age over which pancreaticoduodenectomy would be deleterious. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 1995 to October 2003, 70 elderly patients (range 70&#x02013;84 years) underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer. 38 patients were younger than 75 years (group A) and 32 (group B) were older. Postoperative morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, overall and disease-free survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients from both groups had similar characteristics and were identically managed. There were no statistical differences between the recorded postoperative mortality, morbidity, mean length of hospital stay in the two groups of patients. The mean overall survival was similar in both groups (15 months) and it was significantly influenced only by the histological tumor type, with the worst results in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy in patients over 75 years old do not differ from those recorded in younger patients. It appears that there is no threshold in patients age contraindicating pancreaticoduodenectomy. Overall survival is influenced only by the tumor pathology type.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265761"><strong>38</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF MALIGNANT TUMOR OF THE PANCREAS AND PERIAMPULLARY AREA</div><div class="p" id="__pid265765">Ota AS, Andraus D, Machado A, Azevedo G, Correia M, Ribeiro FS, Fernandes B, General Surgery, Hospital Geral de Bonsucesso, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</div><div class="p" id="__pid265767">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Mostly, patients with periampullary cancers are diagnosed at a stage in which curative resection is not possible.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the period January 2003 to October 2004, 46 patients with periampullary tumor were studied retrospectively. The diagnosis was established by transabdominal ultrasonography and CT. In 27 men (59%) and 19 women (41%) the mean age was 58.9 years old (28&#x02013;86 years). RESULTS: Among these patients, 54% had a pancreatic ductal carcinoma. Procedures were performed in all patients, of which 17 (37%) were duodenopancreatectomies. The mortality rate in the group undergoing Whipple procedure was 35% (6 patients), and the mortality rate for all patients was 37% (16 patients). The average length of hospital stay was 30.7 days (6&#x02013;112 days). Variables analyzed in this study included sex, age, procedure performed, histopathology, mortality, reoperation and survival. CONCLUSION: In recent years, surgery has been considered the gold standard of therapy because new technologies are able to reduce morbility and mortality.

Efforts to improve the patient quality of life lead to palliative procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have performed 162 surgical procedures for pancreatic cancer from May 1998 to October 2004. 73 of them were palliative: in 63 patients biliodigestive anastomosis (38 males and 25 females with median of age 66 years) and in10 palliative resections (5 males and 5 females with median of age 57 years). RESULTS: Palliative bypass: 57 biliodigestive anastomosis and 20 gastroenteroanastomosis were performed. 20 patients developed early complications: wound infection 7, cardial complication 3, pulmonary infection 3, intra-abdominal abscess 2, billiary leak 1, acute pancreatitis 1, others 10. Three patients died in the early postoperative course from heart failure and cancer progression. Palliative resection: 8 patients underwent proximal duodenopancreatectomy and 2 left pancreatectomy. 5 patients developed early complications: intra-abdominal abscess in two patients pancreatic leak, acute postoperative pancreatitis and bronchopneumonia in one case. Two patients died in the early postoperative course from acute pancreatitis and pancreatic leak. 12 (resp. 24, 30) months survival rate in the palliative resection group compared to the bypass procedures was 30%: 21 %, 30%: 10% and 15%: 8% respectively (<em>p</em>&#x0003c;0.05).

The aim of this paper is to report such a case, review and analyze literature behind this rare association and to establish a positive causal link between these three conditions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a case report and review of literature, from a university hospital setting, of an elderly female patient with VRD who underwent pancreato-duodenectomy with resection of proximal jejunum for a periampullary neoplasm, with multiple neurofibromas and a neurofibrosarcoma in the proximal jejunum. RESULTS: Review of the literature suggests that patients with VRD are at an increased risk of developing periampullary neoplasms of neural crest and non-neural crest origin. Carcinoid tumours are the most common form of periampullary tumours associated with VRD. A quarter of all patients with VRD have gastrointestinal involvement in the form of neurofibromas, ganglioneuromas, paragangliomas and neurilemmomas, most commonly located in the distal ileum, with a 10&#x02013;15% risk of malignant transformation.

Unfortunately, detection of second or later primaries often relies on the degree of post treatment surveillance, influencing the prognosis and altering consequences. This study describes a case of double cancers in which cancer of pancreas was associated with carcinoma of the stomach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present here the case of a 72-year-old man who developed synchronous double cancers of pancreas and stomach. The patient was referred to our hospital in January 2004, with a provisional diagnosis of pancreatic tumor. Abdominal CT scan revealed a mass in pancreatic head, and upper digestive endoscopy did not reveal any alteration. A laparotomy was performed and gastroduodeno-pancreatectomy was carried out. RESULTS: The patient was subsequently diagnosed as having double carcinoma of the stomach and pancreas. The histologic sections showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma from the pancreatic head, whereas those from the stomach showed a poor differentiated signet ring cell adenocarcinoma infiltrating until submucosa.

SPN is a low grade malignant tumor that may evolve years before symptoms start. The pathogenesis of the tumor remains unclear and there are no adequate reports to evaluate the management and the long-term control of the neoplasm. However, radical resection should be considered the therapy of choice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe a new case of SPN which occurred in a 36-year-old female who complained of lumbar pain and episodic mild abdominal pain, with a history of cholecystectomy 10 years ago, cystic changes of right breast, mitral valve prolapse and iron deficiency anemia. The tumor mass detected by ultrasound, MRI, CT. The diagnosis was confirmed after all the appropriate histological tests. RESULTS: The tumor was localized at the neck of the pancreas. The preoperative diagnosis was uncertain and distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the spleen was performed. The patient remains free of symtoms. In the immunohistochemical tests the neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, chymotrypsin, a-1-antitrypsin, CD-10, CD-56, with expression of progesterone receptors and mild positivity to chromo-granin, CD-19&#x02013;9, cytokeratins 18 and AE1/AE3.

Novel approaches to perioperative care including shortened preoperative starving periods, preoperative glucose load, sophisticated pain management and early enteral feeding have resulted in major improvements of surgical results after major colorectal surgery. These alterations of perioperative care have been introduced to visceral surgery as so-called fast-track surgery or multimodal rehabilitation. So far it is not known whether or not these approaches can also be applied in pancreatic cancer surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To study this, a prospective non-randomized clinical study was launched investigating the potential beneficial effects of fast-track perioperative care on clinical outcome parameters (complication rates, re-operation rates, time to demission) as well as physiological alterations (glucose tolerance) and immune function (lymphocyte subpopula-tions, circulating interleukins) during the perioperative period of patients undergoing elective pancreatic cancer surgery. Patients recruited for this prospective study receive clear carbohydrate-rich fluid until 2 h before surgery. Bowel preparation is reduced to one administration of a laxative and pain treatment consists of thoracic epidural analgesia in combination with COX-II inhibitors. Intra-operative fluid administration is restricted to 500 ml of colloids and 500 ml of electrolytes. Oral food intake starts on the day of surgery with clear fluids and is increased to a small amount of solid food on day 3 after surgery. Complete enteral nutrition is initiated on day 5 after surgery, following opaque media examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Demission from hospital is planned on day 10 after surgery. RESULTS: This prospective clinical study aims to introduce a novel and successful perioperative care regimen into the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer. Major goal is the improvement of postoperative rehabilitation, including glucose tolerance, mobilization and immune function. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of fast-track pancreatic surgery as well as clinical and immunological results of the recently launched study will be presented.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265887"><em><strong>46</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />NO EVIDENCE OF HELICOBACTER</em> SPECIES IN PERIAMPULLARY TUMORS BY LIGHT MICROSCOPY</div><div class="p" id="__pid265893">Ozden I<sup>2</sup>, Gulluoglu M<sup>1</sup>, Bilge O<sup>2</sup>, Tekant Y<sup>2</sup>, Acarl&#x000fd; K<sup>2</sup>, Alper A<sup>2</sup>, Ar&#x000fd;ogul O<sup>2</sup>, Dizdaroglu F<sup>2</sup>, Emre A<sup>2</sup>, (1) Pathology, Istanbul University-Istanbul Faculty of Medicine; (2) General Surgery-Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery Unit, Istanbul University-Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey</div><div class="p" id="__pid265924">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Epidemiologic studies and investigations on tumor tissues with polymerase chain reaction assays implicate <em>Helicobacter</em> species as a risk factor for pancreatic and biliary carcinomas. However, in contrast with gastric carcinomas, the presence of bacteria in these tumors has not been confirmed by direct methods. A light microscopic study was performed to investigate the possible presence of <em>Helicobacter</em> species in periampullary tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts and surgical specimens of 25 patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (10 pancreatic head carcinomas, 9 distal common bile duct carcinomas, 4 ampulla vateri tumors and 2 duodenal carcinomas) between December 2002 and May 2004 were evaluated retrospectively. The presence of <em>Helicobacter</em> species in tumor tissues was investigated by light microscopy after hematoxylin-eosin, modified Giemsa, and immunohistochemical staining.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the indications for pancreaticoduodenectomy, and describe the surgical technique employed and its complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis including 18 patients submitted to pancreaticoduodenectomy in the timespan from January 2003 to October 2004. The surgical technique employed was gastro-pancreaticoduodenectomy. RESULTS: The pancreatic-enteric anastomosis was performed in an end-to-side fashion with two layers: the first one binds the pancreatic duct to the enteric mucosa, and the second one binds the enteric wall to the pancreatic capsule. A catheter was inserted into the pancreatic duct and its other tip was externalized through the abdominal wall. The biliary-enteric anastomosis was made in an end-to-side fashion with placing of a T-tube through it. This drain was also externalized through the abdominal wall, by a Witzel procedure. The most common etiology was pancreatic head neoplasia. Pyloric preservation was performed in 3 patients. There were 7 deaths, which were associated with cardiovascular complications. There was one biliary fistula with benign behavior. CONCLUSION: Our survey shows patients whose general state was compromised by periampullary neoplasia, undernourishment, anemia and several comorbidities. Nevertheless, the surgical technique employed proved to be safe, bringing down the complication rate in critical patients.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265951"><strong>48</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />THE LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR BLT2: A KEY PLAYER IN PANCREATIC CARCINOGENESIS AND A SPECIFIC MARKER FOR PANCREATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASTIC LESIONS (PANINS)?</div><div class="p" id="__pid265955">Hennig R<sup>3</sup>, Ding XZ<sup>1</sup>, Tong WG<sup>1</sup>, Yokomizo T<sup>2</sup>, B&#x000fc;chler MW<sup>3</sup>, Friess H<sup>3</sup>, Rao S<sup>4</sup>, Talamonti MS<sup>1</sup>, Bell RH<sup>1</sup>, Adrian TE<sup>5</sup>, (1) Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA; (2) Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; (3) Surgery, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; (4) Pathology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA; (5) Surgery and Pathology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA</div><div class="p" id="__pid265989">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Pancreatic cancer has an abysmal prognosis. Targets for early detection, prevention, and therapy are desperately needed. As the 5-lipoxygenase pathway is important for pancreatic cancer development, we examined the expression of the receptors (BLT1R and BLT2R) for its downstream metabolite, leukotriene B4. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Receptor expression was examined in pancreatic cancer cell lines (real-time RT-PCR and Western blot) and tissues (immunocytochemistry). S2-013 cells were stably transfected with BLT1R, BLT2R or empty vector to study the impact on proliferation. RESULTS: BLT1 and BLT2 receptors were expressed (mRNA and protein level) in all pancreatic cancer cell lines. BLT1R were expressed in cancer cells from 10/10 human pancreatic cancers, and islets from these tissues, 7/7 tissues from the resection margins, and 8/9 chronic pancreatitis (CP). No BLT1R staining was seen in PanIN lesions or in 10 pancreatic tissues from multi-organ donors. In contrast, BLT2R were markedly up-regulated in PanINs (7/10 cancer tissues and 1 CP tissue with a PanIN 1b) but not in PanIN 1a lesions or normal ductal cells (9 CP tissues did not stain for BLT2R). Infiltrating tumor cells were strongly positive for BLT2R in cancers and lymph node metastases. Overexpression of BLT1R significantly increased cell proliferation, while overexpression of BLT2R significantly inhibited growth. CONCLUSION: Leukotriene B4 receptors (BLT1R and BLT2R) are overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer. However, BLT2 receptors are already up-regulated in PanINs and their over-expression in tumor cells inhibits growth. BLT2 receptors are an early specific marker and a possible new target for chemoprevention or therapy of pancreatic cancer.</div><div class="p" id="__pid265991"><strong>49</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />INTRADUCTAL PAPILLARY MUCINOUS NEOPLASMS (IPMNS): MANAGEMENT OF THE PANCREATIC MARGIN AND RECURRENCE.

Histology may range from mild dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. The aim of this study is to determine local recurrences after resection and to correlate them with the histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed histology, pancreatic margins, and recurrence rates of 127 patients (70 male, 57 female, mean age 63, range 34&#x02013;83) affected by IPMN who underwent surgical resection in our institution from 1990 to June 2004. RESULTS: 27 patients (21.3%) had adenoma, 37 (29.1%) borderline tumours, 13 (10.2%) <em>in situ</em> carcinoma and 50 patients (39.4%) had invasive carcinoma. 14 patients underwent total pancreatectomy while 113 underwent partial pancreatectomy; in this group resection margins were negative in 73 patients (64.6%), positive for adenoma in 15 (13.3%), positive for borderline in 16 (14.2%), positive for carcinoma in 1 case (0.9%) and with epithelial denudation in 8 cases (7%). Local recurrence was observed in 7 cases (6.2%), after a mean time of 51.4 months (range 37&#x02013;62). After the first resection 5 patients had IPMIC and 1 IPMC, in the resection margins moderate dysplasia (<em>n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>4) and epithelial denudation (<em>n</em>=2) were present; the seventh had an IPMA with negative resection margin. In the latter case progression was observed, actually he showed IPMC after the second operation. CONCLUSION: Local recurrence even with a 'positive' resection margin appears to be more related to the final histology than the pancreatic margin. Because of the long-term disease progression we need to follow the patients up for a longer time.</div><div class="p" id="__pid266032"><strong>50</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />PEPTIDE RECEPTOR RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY IN ENDOCRINE TUMORS OF THE PANCREAS</div><div class="p" id="__pid266036">Nieveen van Dijkum EJ<sup>3</sup>, De Herder W<sup>1</sup>, Kwekkeboom D<sup>2</sup>, Krenning E<sup>2</sup>, van Eijck C<sup>3</sup>, (1) Internal Medicine; (2) Nuclear Medicine; (3) Surgery, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands</div><div class="p" id="__pid266054">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Endocrine pancreatic tumors are known to have somatostatin receptors (SS-Rs), especially subtype SST2 and SST5. Octreotide has a high affinity for SST2 and radio-labeled octreotide is used in an octreoscan to diagnose endocrine tumors. The aim of the present study was to assess if radiolabeled 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3 Octreotate, can also be used in a higher dose as peptide receptor targeted radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-center prospective study including patients with metastatic or locally advanced endocrine pancreatic tumors was performed. Exclusion criteria were little uptake at the octreoscan, Hb &#x0003c;6 mmol/L, WBC &#x0003c;2*109/L, platelets &#x0003c;80*109/L, creatinine clearance &#x0003c;40 ml/min or a Karnofsky score &#x0003c;50. Patients received a cumulative dosage of 750&#x02013;800 mCI through 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3 Octreotate. Toxicity of the therapy was evaluated. Follow-up was performed with routine blood tests, chromogranin-A levels and CT or MRI. The tumor response was measured with CT or MRI using Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) solid tumor response criteria. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients with neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors was included. Two patients died before receiving their final dose. Toxicity was low, with vomiting in 14%, mild nausea in 30%, hair loss in 45% of the patients and stable haematology and kidney function. Complete response after 3 months occurred in 7%, partial response in 47%, stable disease in 31% and disease progression in 14% of the 42 patients. There was a strong correlation between SS-R expression and response to therapy. Chromogranin-A levels showed a clear decrease in patients with a complete or partial response. CONCLUSION: This study showed promising results for radio-nuclide therapy with 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3 Octreotate in patients with neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors. Further studies are needed to elucidate the somatostatin receptors and further tailor the receptor radionuclide therapy.</div><div class="p" id="__pid266056"><strong>51</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />HANDLING OF PANCREATICODUODENECTOMY SPECIMENS INFLUENCES REPORTING OF PROGNOSTICALL Y RELEVANT FINDINGS</div><div class="p" id="__pid266061">Verbeke CS<sup>1</sup>, Menon KV<sup>3</sup>, Guthrie A<sup>2</sup>, Toogood G<sup>3</sup>, McMahon M<sup>3</sup>, Leitch D<sup>1</sup>, Prasad R<sup>3</sup>, (1) Department of Histopathology; (2) Department of Radiology; (3) Department of Surgery, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, UK</div><div class="p" id="__pid266085">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Histopathological examination of pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens (PDEs) resected for adeno-carcinoma is difficult given their complex anatomy and extensive circumferential resection margin (CRM). While the tumour origin (pancreas, common bile duct (CBD) or ampulla), and the RM status have prognostic significance, there is no standardized protocol (SP) for the examination of these specimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Histopathology data of a series reported according to an SP for dissection, photodocumentation, CRM staining and tissue sampling (SP, <em>n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>54) were compared to those of a stage-matched series in which an SP had not been used (non-SP, <em>n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>48). RESULTS: The proportion of pancreatic, ampullary and CBD cancers diagnosed in both series differed significantly (SP: 48%, 28%, 24% vs non-SP: 75%, 17%, 8%). In the SP series the R1 rate (tumour 51 mm to RM) was high (59% vs 46% in non-SP) and showed significant differences between pancreatic (85%), ampullary (27%) and CBD (42%) cancer. Extensive sampling of the CRM in the SP series (8 vs 4 blocks/case in non-SP series) revealed frequent involvement of the retroperitoneal and lateral CRM and rare positivity of the transection margin (46%, 30%, 4%). Lymph node yield (16 vs 11/case) and rate of vascular invasion (69% vs 35%) were higher in the SP series. There was no significant difference in the survival of patients in the non-SP series (R0 vs R1) while in the SP series there was a significant difference (R0 vs R1) (log rank test, <em>p</em>=0.001). CONCLUSION: The handling of PDEs influences the detection of prognostically important findings and standardization is needed to allow consistent reporting, as this does have implications in terms of survival.</div><div class="p" id="__pid266097"><strong>52</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />USEFULNESS OF 18-FDG PET IN THE FOLLOW-UP AFTER RESECTION OF PANCREATIC AND PERIAMPULLARY CARCINOMAS</div><div class="p" id="__pid266102">Sperti C<sup>1</sup>, Pedrazzoli S<sup>4</sup>, Pasquali C<sup>1</sup>, Bissoli S<sup>2</sup>, Fiore V<sup>2</sup>, Scelzi E<sup>3</sup>, Mion M<sup>3</sup> , (1) Scienze Mediche e Chirurgiche, Universit&#x000e1; di Padova, Padova, Italy; (2) Nuclear Medicine, Castelfranco Veneto Hospital (Treviso), Italy; (3) Medical Oncology, Castelfranco Veneto Hospital (Treviso), Italy; (4) Clinica Chirurgica IV, Scienze Mediche e Chirurgiche, Padova, Italy</div><div class="p" id="__pid266127">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Detection of recurrence after resection of pancreatic and periampullary malignancies is often difficult, and recurrent disease, when detected, is usually incurable.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1998 to December 2003, 42 patients (18 males and 24 females, mean age 62.7 years, range 37&#x02013;84) underwent FDG PET after resection of pancreatic <em>(n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>29) or periampullary cancers <em>(n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>13). All patients underwent US, helical CT, chest X-ray and serum tumour markers assay (CEA and CA 19&#x02013;9). Mean follow-up was 29.3 months, range 6&#x02013;76. RESULTS: 28 patients showed tumour recurrence; 21 (75%) had high serum CA 19-9 levels. Sensitivity of FDG PET and CT scan in detecting tumour relapse was 91 % (27/ 28) and 57% (16/28), respectively. Nine of 12 patients with FDG PET-positive/CT scan-negative recurrent tumours were asymptomatic: 5 patients underwent resection (3 paraortic lymph-nodes, 2 liver metastasis), 5 chemotherapy, 1 radiotherapy, and 1 supportive therapy. A second primary tumour was detected by FDG PET and resected in three patients (1 lung and 2 colon carcinomas). A wedge hepatic resection was performed for a CT scan-positive, FDG PET-negative lesion. 11 patients showed no recurrence: FDG PET was negative in all patients, while one patient had transient elevation of CA 19-9 levels and 3 had equivocal CT or US findings. FDG PET altered the clinical management in 8/31 (26%) patients. CONCLUSION: FDG PET is very sensitive in detecting recurrent periampullary carcinomas, allowing changes in the management in one quarter of the patients.</div><div class="p" id="__pid266135"><em><strong>53</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />RISK-ADJUSTED PREDICTION OF OPERATIVE MORBIDITY IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING</em> PANCREATODUODENECTOMY WITH THE USE OF POSSUM</div><div class="p" id="__pid266142">de Castro SMM, Houwert JT, Kuhlmann KFD, Busch ORC, van Gulik TM<sup>1</sup>, Obertop H, Gouma DJ, Surgery, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</div><div class="p" id="__pid266147">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Comparison of operative morbidity rates after pancreatoduodenectomy between units may be misleading because it does not account for the physiological variation of the condition of the patient. The aim of the study was to evaluate the applicability of the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUration of Mortality and Morbidity (POSSUM) for patients who undergo pancreatoduodenectomy and to look for specific risk factors associated with morbidity in a high volume center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1993 and December 2003, 511 patients underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy of which 424 (83%) were for malignant disease. POSSUM was calculated according to the generally accepted criteria. The performance of POSSUM was evaluated by assessing the 'goodness-of-fit' using the exponential analysis method using observed to predicted morbidity (O : P) ratio. Secondly, predictive factors of interest associated with morbidity were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 285 of 511 patients (51%) had one or more complication after pancreatoduodenectomy and 7 patients (1.4%) died. The O:P ratio for POSSUM was 1.09.

RESULTS: A total of 310 pancreatic biopsies were sent for frozen section analysis. There was 98.1% concurrence with histology on formalin-fixed tissue. The false negative rate was 1.9%, with the correct diagnosis being established on subsequent frozen section in half of these cases. The majority of tumours identified were adenocarcinomas, but endocrine tumours, lymphoma, and carcinoid were also detected. 15 (12.5%) patients required more than one set of biopsies in order to establish a diagnosis of malignancy. 19 (15.8%) patients had malignant disease outside the pancreas diagnosed on frozen section biopsy, making their tumours unsuitable for curative resection.

RESULTS: Of 41 pN0 patients, 16 (39%) exhibited single Ber-Ep4 immunoreactive cells or small cell clusters in at least one lymph node (pN0(i<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />+<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />)). The occurrence of ITC was not dependent on other clinicopathological factors, except for the tumor type: in distal bile duct carcinoma, ITC were encountered in each case (100%), whereas they were less frequent in carcinoma of the ampulla (20%) and pancreatic adenocarinoma (36%, <em>p</em>=0.009). ITC impaired patients' prognoses significantly in univariate as well as multivariate analyses (estimated 5-year survival rate: 53% forpN0(i<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />&#x02212;<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />) vs 10% for pN0(i<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />+<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />) and 9% for pN1/2, <em>p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>0.0047). CONCLUSION: ITC are a frequent event in apparently tumor-free lymph nodes of pancreatic cancer patients and overlooked by conventional histopathology. They are encountered even in limited stages of disease and impair patients' prognoses, which is then comparable to true lymph node metastasis. It remains to be further resolved whether those patients may benefit from adjuvant therapy.</div><div class="p" id="__pid266224"><strong>57</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />RELEVANCE OF COLOR DOPPLER ECHOSONOGRAPHY FINDINGS IN ASSESSMENT OF PANCREATIC CARCINOMA RESECTABILITY</div><div class="p" id="__pid266228">Alempijevic T<sup>1</sup>, Kovacevic N<sup>1</sup>, Milicevic M<sup>2</sup>, Krstic M<sup>1</sup>, (1) Clinic for Gastroenterohepatology; (2) Clinic for Abdominal Surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia &#x00026; Montenegro</div><div class="p" id="__pid266243">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: It is highly desirable to achieve the most accurate diagnostic information possible with more noninvasive technology. By defining tumor involvement of blood vassals color Doppler sonography has been increasingly reported as an effective screening tool for clinical staging and treatment decisions in patients with pancreatic neoplasms. Our study aims to analyze sensitivity and specificity of data gathered by different diagnostic techniques in patients with pancreatic neoplasm that are important for treatment decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In presurgical assessment of patients with pancreatic neoplasm, we applied color Doppler ultrasonography, angiography, and endosonography. Patients with metastasis of pancreatic neoplasm were excluded from this study. We examined 27 patients who underwent surgery. Findings of color Doppler ultrasonography were compared with the findings obtained by other techniques, as well as with operative findings. RESULTS: There were 18 male and 9 female patients, aged 41&#x02013;80 years (mean age 58.5). Of the 27 patients, 11 patients underwent a radical surgical procedure, while the rest had palliative operation. Tumor invasion of blood vessels was critical in the decision-making process for the type of surgical treatment. Comparison of color Doppler sonograms and operative findings show that sensitivity of color Doppler sonography for detection of vascular involvement was 80.8% (42/52), whereas its specificity was 83% (112/135), sensitivity of angiography was 70.4% (38/54), and its specificity was 100% (142/142), while sensitivity of endosonography was 90.7% (49/54), and its specificity 85.9% (122/142). CONCLUSION: In comparison to other methods for prediction of pancreatic, neoplasm resectability color Doppler sonography shows a satisfactory rate of sensitivity and specificity. As color Doppler sonography is a noninvasive and inexpensive technique, and considering results of our study and other similar studies, it appears that color Doppler sonography should be used as the initial method for detection of vascular invasion in preoperative assessment of patients with pancreatic neoplasm.</div><div class="p" id="__pid266245"><strong>58</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />MESENTERIC-PORTAL VEIN RESECTION DURING PANCREATECTOMY FOR DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE PANCREAS</div><div class="p" id="__pid266251">Boggi U<sup>1</sup>, Del Chiaro M<sup>1</sup>, Croce C<sup>1</sup>, Gremmo F<sup>1</sup>, Sgambelluri AF<sup>1</sup>, Balzano E<sup>1</sup>, Funel N<sup>2</sup>, Cappelli C<sup>3</sup>, Campani D<sup>2</sup>, Mazzeo S<sup>3</sup>, Mosca F<sup>1</sup>, (1) Division of General and Transplant Surgery; (2) Pathology; (3) Radiology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy</div><div class="p" id="__pid266289">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Mesenteric-portal vein (MPV) involvement has been traditionally considered a contraindication for resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (DAP). However, vein involvement often cannot be ruled out until transec-tion of pancreatic neck and actual prognostic implication of surgically infiltrated MPV has not been defined completely yet. The aim was to analyse the prognostic implications of MPV infiltration in DAP and the postoperative and long-term results of pancreatectomies associated with MPV resections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From November 1987 to May 2004, 128 pancreatectomies associated with vascular resection were performed at our institution. Overall there were 94 vein resections (73.4%) including 77 done for DAP. The mean age of the patients was 64.9 years (range 37&#x02013;84). 39 patients were male (50.6%) and 35 female (49.4%). 48 patients (62.3%) underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, 23 (29.9%) total pancrea-tectomy and 6 (7.8%) subtotal distal pancretectomy. RESULTS: Vascular infiltration was histologically confirmed in 42 cases (54.5%). Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 37.6% (29/77) and 2.5% (2/77), respectively. 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates for the patients who underwent pancreatectomies associated with MPV resection were 55%, 18.7% and 10.2%, respectively. 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of patients with histologically unconfirmed vascular infiltration were significantly higher as compared with patients with confirmed vascular infiltration (72.1 %, 30.1% and 20.1% vs 47.7%, 5.6% and 5.6%; <em>p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />0.025).</em> CONCLUSION: MPV resection neither increases the risk of pancretectomies, nor reduces long-term survival as compared to standard pancreatectomies. Interestingly, lack of histologic proof of tumor involvement is associated with statistically relevant survival benefit.</div><div class="p" id="__pid266294"><strong>59</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />COMBINED ENDOSCOPIC AND LAPAROSCOPIC ULTRASOUND IN THE EVALUATION OF RESECTABILITY IN PANCREATIC CANCER</div><div class="p" id="__pid266299">Nielsen HO, Fristrup C, Mortensen M, Pless T, Durup J, Ainsworth A, Hovendal C, Department of Surgical Gastroenterology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark</div><div class="p" id="__pid266301">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: An accurate pretherapeutic assessment of the resectability in pancreatic cancer patients is essential in order to reduce the number of futile surgical explorations. The aim of this study was to assess the combination of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) in the detection of patients with non-resectable tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2002 to 2004, 166 consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer referred for surgical treatment were included. 28 (17%) patients were excluded due to co-morbidity and poor perfomance status. Patients were first examined with EUS followed by LUS, if EUS found no signs of non-resectability. Only patients found to be resectable or possibly resectable at EUS and LUS were offered surgical treatment. Resectabilty criteria were defined prior to the study. RESULTS: 102 (74%) patients were non-resectable by the defined criteria. EUS identified 65 (64%) patients (43 due to tumor size, 7 due to metastasis and 15 due to both) and LUS identified an additional 24 (24%) patients (13 due to tumor size, 10 due to metastasis, 1 with aortic aneurysm). Thus, a total of 89 (87%) patients were non-resectable at either EUS or LUS. 49 (36%) patients underwent surgery. Five patients had surgical exploration and three patients had palliative surgery. 41 patients were resected with curative intention of which 36 had an R0 resection and 5 had a palliative resection. CONCLUSION: The combination of EUS and LUS is highly efficient in identifying non-resectable patients and this strategy can reduce the need for surgical exploration.</div><div class="p" id="__pid266303"><strong>60</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />RADIOFREQUENCYABLATION (RFA) IN PANCREATIC CANCER</div><div class="p" id="__pid266307">Hadjicostas P<sup>1</sup>, Symeonidis P<sup>1</sup>, Malakounidis N<sup>1</sup>, Varianos C<sup>1</sup>, Kitiris E<sup>1</sup>, Lerni F<sup>2</sup>, (1) Surgical Department; (2) Anesthesiology Department, Nicosia's General Hospital, Strovolos, Nicosia, Cyprus</div><div class="p" id="__pid266330">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: RFA is effective in the treatment of unresectable hepatic tumors and promising results also have been described in tumors of kidney, lung, brain, prostate and breast. The radiofrequency (RF) destruction of solid pancreatic tumors sounds logical but also seems risky due to the friable pancreatic parenchyma, the fear of pancreatitis and the prejudiced myth that the pancreas is not your friend. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present our initial experience and we describe our technique during intraopera-tive RFA in 3 patients with locally advanced and unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (head of pancreas 2, body-tail 1/median d: 7 cm). In all, the RFA was followed by bypass palliative procedures (cholecysto-jejunostomy and Brown's anastomosis and/or gastro-jejunostomy). Drainage tube was left close to the ablated area. Serum amylase and fluid amylase (drain) was measured for 5&#x02013;7 days post-operatively. Sandostatin was also administered prophylactically for 5 days. RESULTS: In all the patients the postoperative period was uneventful without complications or evidence of pancreatitis. The post RFA CT scan showed in all remarkable changes in the density and the characteristics of the tumors (?destruction). The patients are alive (8 months, 2 months, 3 weeks postoperatively). In one patient (Ca of the body of pancreas) who was on morphine because of intolerable pain a significant pain relief has been observed. CONCLUSION: From our initial results, RFA seems to be a feasible, potentially safe and promising option in patients with locally advanced and unresectable pancreatic cancer. Nevertheless, larger series of cases are needed to secure our encouraging results.</div><div class="p" id="__pid266332"><strong>61</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />DELAYED VISCERAL ARTERIAL BLEEDING AFTER PANCREATIC HEAD RESECTION</div><div class="p" id="__pid266336">Makowiec F, Hopt U, Adam U, Department of Surgery, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany</div><div class="p" id="__pid266338">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Despite low mortality complications are frequent after pancreatic head resection. The occurrence of delayed visceral arterial bleeding (DVAB) from branches of the celiac trunc or the gastroduodenal artery is rare but life-threatening and under-reported in the literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1994, 464 pancreatic head resections were performed. DVAB was defined as bleeding from branches of the celiac axis. We treated 12 patients with DVAB. Three of those were referred for bleeding. RESULTS: The frequency of DVAB was 1.9%. DVAB occurred a median of 24 days after surgery. Presentation was gastrointestinal <em>(n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />7)</em> or abdominal bleeding <em>(n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>5). Median transfusions were 12.5 units. Bleeding sites were the common hepatic <em>(n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />5),</em> gastroduodenal (<em>n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>5), splenic <em>(n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em> 1) orpancreatoduodenal artery <em>(n<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />=<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /></em>1). Angiography was performed in 10 patients and controlled bleeding in 6. One patient died during angiography. In three patients bleeding control was not possible, they underwent surgery. Surgical control was obtained in 5 patients by ligatures of the common hepatic artery (2), gastroduodenal artery (2) and splenic artery (1). Of the surviving 11 patients all 6 with maintained hepatic artery blood flow had an uneventful further course. After hepatic artery occlusion 4/5 patients had complications (3 liver abcess, one bile leak). One of the patients with liver abscesses died 4 months later. CONCLUSION: DVAB bleeding is a severe complication after pancreatic head resection. In the most frequently encountered lesions of the common hepatic artery or the gastroduodenal artery stump bleeding control should optimally be achieved by angiographic stenting, as the preservation of hepatic blood flow prevents further severe complications.</div><div class="p" id="__pid268103"><strong>62</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />PERIAMPULLARY TUMORS: EXPERIENCE WITH 945 CASES</div><div class="p" id="__pid268108">Fathy OM<sup>2</sup>, El-Ebidy G<sup>1</sup>, Kandiel T<sup>1</sup>, El-Shobari M<sup>1</sup>, (1) ERCP, Gastroenterology Surgical Center; (2) Surgery, Gastroenterology Surgical Center, Mansoura, Egypt</div><div class="p" id="__pid268124">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The aim of this work is to evaluate the outcome of different modalities of treatment of patients with periampullary tumors, surgical resection (Whipple operation), versus palliative bypass (surgical or endoscopic). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the period from 1995 to 2001, 945 patients were included in this study. Mean age was 58&#x000b1;11 years with no statistical significant difference between different groups. Male to female ratio was 1.64:1. Larger mass mean size was detected in irresectable tumors: 51&#x000b1;18 mm compared to 37&#x000b1;16 mm in patients who underwent surgical resection. RESULTS: Surgical resection could be achieved in 216 cases (22.9%), in 182 (84.7%) the reconstruction was by pancreaticogastrostomy and in 33 (15.3%) by pancreaticojejunostomy. A comparative study between the 2 modalities of reconstruction proved the superiority of pancreatico-gastrostomy. Surgical palliative bypass was done in 100 cases (10.6%), in 88 cases by choledochojejunostomy Roux-en-Y, in the other 12 cases cholecystojejunostomy was performed. The latter procedure is not recommended any more. In the remaining 629 advanced cases endoscopic stenting was done as permanent drainage. The net results show that although endoscopic stent had the shortest hospital stay (2.5&#x000b1;5.8 days), it needs several read-missions ranging from 1 to 5 times, while hospital stay after surgical resection and surgical bypass was 11.7&#x000b1;8.6 and 5.9&#x000b1;3, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surgery gives the best long-term result, endoscopic stenting is reserved for palliation in poor risk patients.</div><div class="p" id="__pid268126"><strong>63</strong><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" /><img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2003.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />PERIPHERAL INTRADUCTAL PAPILLARY MUCINOUS NEOPLASMS: WHERE ARE WE GOING?</div><div class="p" id="__pid268130">Salvia R<sup>1</sup>, Bassi C<sup>1</sup>, Falconi M<sup>1</sup>, Guarise A<sup>2</sup>, Serini P<sup>1</sup>, Crippa S<sup>1</sup>, Marcucci S<sup>1</sup>, Pederzoli P<sup>1</sup>, (1) Surgery, University of Verona; (2) Radiology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy</div><div class="p p-last" id="__pid268158">INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Some authors showed that 'branch-duct' intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) may have a less aggressive biological behaviour, suggesting limited resection or, at least, a conservative surgical treatment. The aim was to analyse our decision making in the branch-duct IPMNs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with a diagnosis of peripheral IPMN observed or treated by resection in the Surgical Department of the University of Verona over the period from 1990 to June 2004 were included in the study. All patients observed were submitted to MRCP to confirm the communication with the main duct. RESULTS: We considered 144 pts (53%) affected by peripheral IPMN over 272 with a final diagnosis of IPMN. In this group we resected 56 (39%) (Group A), the final diagnosis was adenoma in 22 (39.3%), 17 (30.4%) borderline, 9 (16%) <em>in situ</em> carcinoma and 8 pts (14.3%) had invasive carcinoma. The pts observed with a presumptive diagnosis of peripheral still benign IPMNs are 88 (61 %) (Group B). The median age in the two groups was 62.3 and 64.1 years, respectively, the rate of asymptomatic patients was 17.8% vs 100% (p<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />&#x0003c;<img src="../corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " title="" />0.01); the median diameter of the lesions was 40 mm in Group A and 17 mm in Group B. Five patients were submitted to resection during the follow-up (5.7%) and the final diagnosis was adenoma in 2 and borderline in 3. CONCLUSION: This is the first report in the literature about the follow-up of a large series of peripheral IPMNs. We agree with the tendency of less aggressiveness of the peripheral IPMNs. The final diagnosis of the resected peripheral IPMNs demonstrates that the clinical-laboratory-radiological parameters that we usually use are helpful to distinguish benign from malignant IPMNs previous surgery.</div></div></div>
